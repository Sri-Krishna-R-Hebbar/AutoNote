The Lost Key

Aman rushed home after a long day, the weight of deadlines and meetings pressing down on him. All he wanted was to collapse onto his couch and lose himself in a good book. As he reached his door, a familiar wave of anticipation washed over him. He patted his pockets, ready to unlock the sanctuary he craved.

Empty.

His keys were missing. A jolt of panic shot through him. He hadn't lost them in years. The familiar click of metal against metal, the comforting weight in his pocket – gone.

He took a deep breath, trying to quell the rising tide of frustration. Retrace your steps, he told himself. He started back, mentally revisiting the events of his day.

The cafe. He remembered juggling his latte and his briefcase, almost spilling it on a woman in a bright red scarf. He checked the table, the counter, even behind the newspaper rack. Nothing.

The bookstore. He’d spent a blissful hour browsing, losing himself in the pages of a worn copy of "Moby Dick." He questioned the clerk, scanned the aisles he’d traversed, even peeked under the comfortable armchair he'd briefly occupied. Still nothing.

The park. He'd taken a detour to soak up the last rays of the setting sun. He walked the path again, his eyes scanning the grass, the flowerbeds, the space under the park bench where he’d briefly sat. Hopeless.

The sun was beginning to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple, but Aman barely noticed. His shoulders slumped. He was about to give up, resigned to calling a locksmith and facing a hefty bill.

Then, he saw him. An old man sitting on the very bench he'd rested on in the park. The man was watching him, a gentle smile playing on his lips. He raised a hand, a beacon in Aman's growing despair.

"Looking for this?" the man asked, his voice raspy but kind. He held up his hand, and dangling from his fingers, glinting in the fading light, were Aman’s keys.
