This is a good start to a story! It effectively establishes a sense of unease and foreshadowing. Here are a few suggestions to build on this:

**Strengths:**

*   **Sensory Details:** "City lights blurred," "train jolted," "lights flickered," "air grew thick, heavy" are all great sensory details that create a vivid picture and atmosphere.
*   **Ravi's Isolation:** The "No signal" and his focus on his "reflection in the window" highlight his isolation and perhaps a sense of being trapped.
*   **Sense of Foreboding:** "Tonight something felt off" is a classic way to introduce suspense and make the reader wonder what's about to happen.
*   **Intriguing Opening:** It sets the stage for something unusual or potentially dangerous.

**Potential Improvements & Questions to Consider:**

*   **Why is Ravi Typically Focused on His Reflection?** Is he self-absorbed, insecure, or simply bored? Knowing this would add depth to his character.
*   **Expand on "Something Felt Off":** Can you give the reader a slightly more specific clue? A cold draft? A strange smell? An odd sound? A feeling of being watched? (Subtlety is key!)
*   **What is Ravi's Motivation?** Where is he going? Coming from? Does he have something important on his mind?
*   **Pace:** You've established the setting well. Consider picking up the pace slightly to increase the tension.

**Here are a few ways you could continue the story, incorporating some of these suggestions:**

**Option 1 (Subtle and Atmospheric):**

> Ravi found a seat near the middle and pulled out his phone. No signal, as usual. Typically, his sight stayed fixed on his reflection in the window, a pale ghost superimposed on the blurry city lights. The train picked up speed, the rhythmic clatter a familiar lullaby. But tonight, the lullaby felt off-key. The train jolted harder than usual, the lights flickering like dying fireflies. He couldn't shake the feeling that every pair of eyes was fixed on him, even though no one seemed to look his way. The air inside the compartment grew thick, heavy, laced with the metallic tang of ozone. He shifted uncomfortably, his gaze darting to the emergency brake lever. Just in case.

**Option 2 (More Direct):**

> Ravi found a seat near the middle and pulled out his phone. No signal. Typically, he'd lose himself in his reflection, a way to escape the drudgery of the commute. The city lights blurred as the train picked up speed, taking him further from the office, further from the deadline he'd missed. The train jolted violently. The lights flickered, plunged into darkness for a terrifying second, then flickered back on, dimmer now. Ravi found he had taken this route hundreds of times, but tonight something felt distinctly wrong. A chill, unnatural and sharp, cut through the stale air. The air inside the compartment grew thick, heavy, and a low hum, almost subsonic, vibrated through the floor. He saw a woman across the aisle clutching her purse, her eyes wide with fear.

**Option 3 (Character Focused):**

> Ravi found a seat near the middle and pulled out his phone, half expecting a message from Maya. No signal. Typically, his sight stayed glued to his reflection in the window, avoiding eye contact with the other passengers. He still felt guilty about their argument that morning. The city lights blurred as the train picked up speed, carrying him further away from his problems, if only temporarily. The train jolted, throwing him forward. The lights flickered, momentarily blacking out his reflection. Ravi found he had taken this route hundreds of times, but tonight a prickling unease crawled up his spine. The air inside the compartment grew thick, heavy, and he could swear the temperature had dropped ten degrees. Maybe he was just imagining things, letting his anxiety get the better of him.

Choose the direction that best suits the story you want to tell and keep building on those sensory details and the growing sense of unease. You're off to a great start!
