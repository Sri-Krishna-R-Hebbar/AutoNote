        "text": " What is going on? It's Medicos' Perfect Status where medicine makes perfect sense. This is the ultimate biology review video. First of all, let me be clear. Trying to review all of biology in less than 90 minutes is an insane task. I'm going to go over the most important points in this video and we'll do this in the following order. We will start by talking about the cell and what's in it. Of course, there is the nucleus with DNA and the cytoplasm with the organelles. Then we'll talk about  After this, embryogenesis and the fetal circulation. Followed by the nervous system, somatic and autonomic. Central nervous system versus peripheral nervous system. After that, the endocrine system. Then, the respiratory system. Followed by the cardiovascular system. Next, the immune system. Digestive system, homeostasis, which includes kidney and skin. Musculoskeletal system,  bone and muscle. And last will be genetics and evolution. So let's go. This video will be a very quick review. If you want the detailed explanation, go to my biology playlist. First, cell theory. Prokaryotes versus eukaryotes. Karyote is the nucleus. So which one has the true nucleus, the true nut? Eukaryotes. It's a true nucleus bound by a membrane. And it's not just the nucleus. Even the organelles are bound by membranes. Eukaryotes have mitochondria.  can make their own energy. Their DNA is protein bound but the prokaryotes have naked DNA. In eukaryotes the DNA is linear, anti-parallel. In prokaryotes it is circular. Give me one example of prokaryotes, bacteria. How about eukaryotes? We have many including mammals which will include humans. What are the fundamental tenets of the cell theory?  What kind of lipid?  it on the outside. How about the tail? Well, the tail is on the inside because it hates water. It loves lipid, but it hates water. Hydrophobic, lipophilic. And since there is water outside the cell and water inside the cell, we will put the water-loving hydrophilic heads towards water, i.e. on the outside and the inside, and we will hide this hydrophobic tail away from water. Just bury it in the center. What's the genetic material? DNA, which is  Organized in chromosomes you find chromosomes inside the nucleus. How about the organelles like the mitochondria? You'll find it in the cytoplasm The mitochondria will give you energy in form of ATP since the sperm needs lots and lots of energy It has lots and lots of mitochondria if you want to secrete a lot like the pancreas you will need lots of Golgi and endoplasmic reticuli Don't you ever forget that red blood cells do not have organelles. They do not have mitochondria therefore  There is no TCA cycle or electron transport chain inside the red blood cell. Let's talk about these organelles. The mitochondria is the powerhouse. Ligosome is the soldier. It destroys foreign invaders. How about endosome? The delivery guy. Endoplasmic reticulum comes in two shapes, rough and smooth. The rough is the translator. We translate proteins for secretion. We need rough endoplasmic and Golgi to work together. How about the smooth? This is the donut.  for fat synthesis. Look how smooth this fat belly is. Golgi is the sorter. It modifies cellular products and directs them for delivery and it works in conjunction with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Peroxisome from peroxide is the gym trainer. It destroys fat. Is there a difference between cytosol and cytoplasm? Yes. Cytosol is just fluid with no organelles. If you want to add the fluid cytosol to the organelles, now we have cytoplasm.  If you want to add the cytoplasm to nucleus you get protoplasm. Here is your cell and your cell membrane. Inside we have protoplasm which is nucleus and cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is organelles plus cytosol. Next the nucleus. This is the control room of your body. Why? Because it has the DNA. DNA carries your genes and don't forget the story of the nuclear pores inside the nuclear membrane. These pores allow entry and  and exit from and to the nucleus. The outer membrane of the nucleus is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This is how you make and then secrete proteins. Here's your DNA double helix. Wrap it around histones. Wrap it around. Wrap it around. Wrap... Before you know it, we have your chromosomes. How many of these do you have in each somatic cell? 46 chromosomes. Do you remember the nuclear pore? Yeah, this is when mRNA tries  to leave. Why does it want to leave? Because it will get translated later in the cytoplasm. If you want to make another copy of DNA, this is called replication. If you want to convert DNA into RNA, this is called transcription. If you want to translate the RNA into meaningful proteins, this is called translation. By the way, you can download these notes and all of the notes in the entire biology series at MedicosysPerfectionitis.com.  For assembly of ribosome, ribosome, this is the sense of it, ribosomal RNA, the rRNA. Your average cell has only one nucleus. Red blood cells have none. Osteoclasts of bones have many. Sometimes the nucleus is lobated or segmented such as your neutrophils, which are white blood cells or leukocytes. Next, the powerhouse. The mighty mitochondria provides you with energy. This is on a good day, but  on a bad day it will kill your cell. Why is this? Because this cell is old, malfunctioning, starting to become harmful, so it's gotta go. Who's gonna let her go? Mitochondria. What do you call it when the cell plans its own death? Apoptosis. Here's the structure of the mitochondria. Please pause and review. When you keep pumping protons, pumping protons, pumping protons, this is called electron transport chain. What does it happen in the mitochondria?  pumping  DNA from your mother only not from your father because your daddy's sperm left his tail outside He left the mitochondria outside red blood cells again No mitochondria, but liver cell jazillion mitochondria next the destroyer Let's destroy foreign invaders and let's destroy our own stuff That is senescent and no longer of value. The lysosome is a destroyer because it contains hydrolytic  enzymes that work in an acidic medium. How come the lysosome is not killing me at all times? Because these hydrolytic digestive enzymes are protected and kept inside the lysosome thanks to the lysosomal membrane. If you're a foreign invader, the lysosome will destroy you by endocytosis first and then destruction. If you are coming from within, i.e. old senescent harmful particle, then will destroy you by autophagy.  In the former process the lysozome needs help from the endozome for endocytosis, but in the latter process it needs help from the phagosome for phagocytosis. Here's the lysozome with the hydrolactic enzymes engulf and destroy. There is a protein here that helps this vesicle separate from the membrane. The name is called clathrin. They love to ask about clathrin on the exam. Next, the endoplasmic reticulum is  rough and smooth. Don't forget that it's continuous with the nuclear membrane. The rough is the translator to translate proteins which were coded for in the DNA of the nucleus and then secrete them to the outside. That's why its membrane is continuous with the nuclear membrane. The smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the donut. The rough has ribosomes. Rough ribosomes, but the smooth no ribosomes. Function of the rough ER  Translation i.e. protein synthesis i.e. to convert the RNA into proteins. How about the function of the smooth reticulum? Fat synthesis and detoxification.  Steroid hormones are made of fat and these include the sex hormones such as estrogen progesterone and androgens Next is the SOTA. SOTA them and direct them for delivery. The Golgi works with the endoplasmic reticulum. The nucleus has the code and it makes RNA in a process known as transcription. Then this mRNA will leave the nucleus through the nuclear pore and will go to the cytoplasm where it will get translated  in  Peroxisome  Here is hydrogen peroxide. Why do you need this peroxide for beta oxidation of fat? Lipid catabolism. Why do you need this hydrogen peroxide, Mr. Peroxisome? Because it can help me kill foreign invaders. This is the story of the reactive oxygen species or free radicals. And this is a lovely peroxide for you. Some diseases in medicine are peroxisomal diseases such as adrenoleukodystrophy.  On your biology exam, assume that all X-linked diseases are X-linked recessive unless they tell you otherwise. If it's X-linked recessive, it's gonna be more common in boys. Next, the cytoskeleton. What's the most abundant thing in every cell in your body? It's water. What's the second most abundant? Proteins. We have two types of proteins in the cell. Structural, for the cytoskeleton, and functional, for enzymes, pores, channels, pumps, etc.  Your cytoskeleton is a protein network. Who made it? Well, ribosome again because it's a protein. It helps the entire cell move, cytokinesis, it helps the cell divide during cell division, mitosis or meiosis, and it provides railroad tracks so that you can move your packages on the railroad. The cytoskeleton has gazillion other functions. Pause and review. There are three types of cytoskeleton.  and intermediate filaments, microfilaments, actin. How about microtubules? Alpha tubulin or beta tubulin? And you find microtubules in cilia or flagella. First, microfilaments. Remember my actin? You start with monomers, then they become polymers of G-actin. And then before you know it, you have your actin filaments. Actin filaments have many functions, including cell division. These are your cleavage furrows that you studied in mitosis.  or meiosis for that matter. Next, microtubules which have tubulin. You have alpha tubulin and beta tubulin. Microtubules can provide the backbone for many structures. If you want to make a centriole, easy. I'll give you nine triplets of microtubules and you will have a centriole. But if you want a cilium or a flagellum, I'll give you nine doublets, not triplets, of microtubules plus two additional ones. Don't forget the story of kinesin and diatomaceous  Dynine Defect is seen in a disease known as Cartagena's Syndrome or Immotile Cilia Syndrome. Here is the cilia as you know, nine doublets of microtubules plus two extra ones. Cilia could be motile such as the one in your respiratory tract to get all the gunk out of your airways or they could be immotile such as the special ones in the rods of the eye. If I have Cartagena's Syndrome or Immotile Cilia Syndrome,  Celiac Syndrome, then the cilia in my fallopian tube will not work and I can get ectopic pregnancy because I was unable to push the ovum from the fallopian tube to the uterine cavity because I did not have cilia. There are many genetic diseases that will give me respiratory problems including Cartesian syndrome where the problem is in the diane arm of cilia and cystic fibrosis which is a CFTR mutation. The first diseases have  No motile cilia the other disease is having very thick mucus because of a defect in the chloride channel flagella Structurally speaking very similar to cilia nine doublets of microtubules plus two single Central ones the sperm has a flagellum and H pylori bacteria has a flagellum too. This is the nasty bacteria that lives in the stomach Here's the structure of cilia or flagella. We have nine doublet  on the periphery and two single microtubules centrally. What if I want to make a centriole, not cilia or flagella? Then you go with triplets, nine triplets of microtubules. Remember that your cytoskeleton had microfilaments, actin, microtubules, tubulin, and intermediate filaments. These intermediate filaments are different types depending on your tissue. Different tissues have different types.  If you're talking about your mesenchymal cells, your intermediate filament will be vimentin. If you're talking about your epithelial cells, keratin. Your neural cells, neurofilaments, nuclear envelope, lamine, muscles, desmin, neuroglial cells, GFAP. Next, we'll talk about types of tissue, including your epithelial tissue and your connective tissue. As you know, what's the building unit of your body? The cell. Group of cells together? Tissue. Group of tissues together? Organ.  Speaking of tissues, you have four types of tissues. Epithelium, connective muscle nerve. Epithelium, I cover your surfaces, I line your cavities. Doesn't that sound filthy? I stand upon a basement membrane. I am the parenchyma of your cells. Suppose we're talking about any gland in your body. The gland will have a parenchyma, the actual functioning cells, such as the nerve.  neurons in your brain, the alveoli in your lungs, and basically this will be mostly epithelial cells. And the stroma which is just for support, inner support, outer support, etc. And the stroma will be the connective tissue. Here are examples of epithelium in your body. Please pause and review. And here are different types of epithelium based on the number of layers or based upon the shape of the epithelium. Next, bringing people together. The connective tissue.  about ligaments, bones, blood, tendons, fat, lymph. These are basically mostly connective tissue. The actual function is undertaken by the parenchyma, i.e. epithelium. But for the support, you'll need your connective tissue. Connective tissue. You speak about yourself.  and elastin, so I'm not that useless. Epithelium is here, connective tissue is here. If I flip you upside down, metaphorically speaking, will your organs fall out of place? The answer is no. Why not? Connective tissue, baby. Here are some examples of connective tissue. We're talking bones, cartilages, fat cells or adipose cells, tendons, muscles. Some textbooks even include blood and lymph as types of connective tissue. Next,  Cell cycle when you are resting your g0 and then you grow growth phase 1 and then you make DNA synthesis and then you grow again growth 2 and then mitosis or meiosis m phase Somatic cells versus germ cells pause and review if I want to make another copy of my DNA This is called DNA replication which happens during the s phase of the cell cycle taking the DNA into RNA is  Where is the actual division happening in the M phase? Mitosis or meiosis? That's why anything else is an interphase. G0 is for rest. G1 is for growth because we're preparing for the S. In the S phase, you'll synthesize another copy of DNA. Hashtag replication. Then in the G2, you grow again. And then in the M phase, you have mitosis or mitosis.  meiosis. Pro, meta, anatelo, pro, meta, anatelo, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase. Pause and review. If the question asks you, when does karyokinesis and cytokinesis take place? The answer is M phase. And here are some pearls for you. Pause and review. Cell types. You have permanent cells or stable or labile cells. Labile cells are always dividing. Permanent cells do not divide. Stable cells do not  under normal circumstances, but under crazy circumstances, they can divide, such as your liver. Permanent, do not divide, such as your neurons. Labile, always dividing, such as sperm cells, GI cells, your hair, etc. Staple cells are only under certain conditions, like the liver. If my cells are dividing like crazy, with no check, this is cancer. How does chemotherapy work? They stop, or  arrest cell division. What's the good news? We're killing cancer cells. What's the bad news? We're also killing some of your cells, especially those who divide very rapidly. That's why with chemotherapy you get hair loss and diarrhea. Cell cycle checkpoints to recognize the mutation or the error early on so that we can stop cell division. Otherwise, we can get cancer. We have three main checkpoints in the cell cycle. The first one is at the  Or to be more precise, it's between G1 and S. So that if you discover an error, you do not go to S. Recall that the p53 and the RB genes are tumor suppressor genes. The second checkpoint is here between the G2 and the M so that you do not progress to the M phase with an error. And the third checkpoint is in the M phase. It's called the metaphase checkpoint. And remember, during the metaphase,  Everything is aligned in the midline and we think our mitotic spindle. Defects in any area of the cell cycle checkpoints can lead to diseases and here are some examples. Please pause and review. More examples, pause and review. And some more. If you have trouble with these, please check the original video called Cell Cycle Checkpoint in my biology playlist.  Then you'll get what? Tumors! Which could be benign or could be malignant.  not identical to the parent cell. In fact, each new offspring is half the parent. What are the phases? Pro, Meta, Ana, Tello. Pro, before, we're preparing. Meta, everything is in the midline. Ana, separate me. And then what's your telos and purpose in life? That's the last part.  of the centriole pairs. Formation of the mitotic spindle, we're getting ready, and dissolution of the nuclear membrane. Next, metaphase, everything is M. We are in the midline, thanks to the mitotic spindle, which is basically microtubule. And you can draw the line in the sand here, and you get a mirror image, also an M. We are aligned in the midline. Anaphase, separate me up. Split the centromere and separate the sister chromatids.  The kinetochore is doing the pulling. In telophase, the mitotic spindle disappears. We reform the nuclear membrane. We form these cleavage furrows. Thank you, microfilaments. And then you separate the cell into two cells. This is called cytokinesis. Meiosis. There is meiosis one and there is meiosis two. Here is another comparison between mitosis and meiosis. Please pause and review. You know the saying that meiosis two is almost  Next, reproduction. This is the anatomy of the female reproductive tract. And here's the one for the male. Gonads. In female, we're talking about the ovary. The gonad in males, the testicle. How about the gametes? Remember, this is meiotic division. In females, the gamete is the ovum. In males, the gamete is the sperm. Here is spermatogenesis. And this is oogenesis. Unlike spermatogenesis, spermatogenesis is a genetic division.  Contrary to popular belief, fertilization is not when the sperm meets the ovum. Let's get technical. It's when the sperm meets the secondary oocyte, which is arrested in metaphase 2.  If you remember this is my hypothalamus. Here is my anterior pituitary, which is  makes LH and FSH to influence the gonads and then the gonads will give you the male hormones or the female hormones. This is the effect in the male. GnRH from the hypothalamus will tell the anterior pituitary to make LH and FSH. FSH influences the sirtoli cell to feed the sperm and to help with aromatization. But the LH is for lytic cell which is to make testosterone. So what's the purpose of FSH in male? From to.  I mean aromatization from the female hormone to the male hormone. And then LH in males lead XL to make testosterone and the even more powerful dihydrosteosterone. But what's the effect of FSH in females? It's called the follicle stimulating hormone. It stimulates the growth of the ovarian follicle. How about LH in females? It's called luteinizing hormone. It helps make the luteal body, which will secrete progesterone until the placenta takes over.  Let's make an ovum! Follicle-seminating hormone is gonna semenate that follicle growth. And then what? And then the LH is gonna surge around day 14 and phew! Rupture the follicle, release the ovum. The ovum will go to the  the uterus. The rest of the follicle will become luteal body which secretes progesterone. If fertilization happens, progesterone and estrogen will remain high. But if it did not happen, progesterone will drop, estrogen will drop, and the uterine lining will drop. Hashtag menses or menstrual bleeding. Pause and review. These are the phases of the menstrual cycle. We have proliferation phase. Thank you, estrogen. Secretory phase. Thank you, progesterone.  and some estrogen. Menstruation phase. Everything is dropping like a rock. Here's the function of FSH, follicle, LH, the surge and the rupture. Hashtag ovulation. And then the estrogen, female sex characteristics, and then progesterone, female secondary sex characteristics, and it sustains the endometrium of the uterus, and it raises the core body temperature in the second half of the cycle because progesterone is more abundant in the second half of the cycle.  the ovum, please pause and review. The steps of fertilization are 5. Capacitation, acrosoma reaction, polyspermy block, completion of meiosis 2, where the secondary oocyte was arrested in, metaphase 2, and then you make a zygote. Capacitation is to increase the capacity, thank you so much, calcium. Next is the acrosoma reaction. Recognition happens, release of hydrolytic enzymes, so that the sperm can pierce  through the zona pellucida. Next, to avoid double and triple and quadruple fertilization, there is polyspermy block to avoid polyploidy. After this, you complete meiosis 2, where the secondary oocyte was arrested in metaphase 2. Now the secondary oocyte is ready to become an ovum. After this, zygote formation. Congratulations! A zygote is one complete cell with 46 chromosomes, and then it will grow and grow.  embryo and then grow and grow fetus after birth you are a neonate within an infant after fertilization there is cleavage mitotic division and then blastulation to make a blastocyst here's the blastocyst we have an inner cell mass which will become the embryo itself and an outer cell mass trophoblast which will become the placenta fertilization then cleavage then blastulation after this implantation  augmentation in the uterine wall. Then you have the bilaminar embryo epiblast and hypoblast and the trilaminar embryo endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm. When you try to generate different layers, this is called gastrulation. Please pause and review. Here is the bilaminar embryo and the trilaminar embryo. You need to memorize everything on this slide. If you want to learn about neurulation, check out my video called Neurolation in this biology series.  But please remember that the nervous system comes from the ectoderm. The central nervous system, i.e. brain and spinal cord, come from the neural tube. The peripheral nervous system comes from the neural crest cells. This is your spinal cord, for example. The spinal cord itself is central nervous system, therefore neural tube. But the spinal nerves are peripheral nervous system, therefore neural crest cells. This is your neural tube early on. The anterior neural port  this will become your brain, but the posterior neuropore will become your spinal cord.  the mesoderm alone such as mesodermal cell and the mesenchyme of your bone marrow. They are pluripotent. For example, the bone marrow can only give you blood cells, not every single imaginable cell. Do adults have stem cells? Yes, they do. In fact, this is how you regenerate. The stem cells of your skin are the basal layer or the stratum basalis. In the alveoli, they are type 2 pneumocytes. Please remember that type 2 pneumocytes have two functions.  Function number one, they are the stem cells of your lungs. Function number two is to release surfactant, which is anti-surface tension. The stem cell of your bone marrow is the hematopoietic stem cell, which is pluripotent. And the cell that regenerates sperms is spermatogonia. Apoptosis versus necrosis, please pause and review. We have two types of cell regeneration. There is complete and incomplete. Each time you undergo cell division and you pass through the cell cycle,  Once you're getting older. Your telomeres are shortened. Do this many times and you are senescent. Old. When your telomeres are shortening, it means that you are aging. But what if my telomeres do not shorten? Like ever. Is this a good thing? Shut up. It's a horrible thing. It increases your risk of cancer. This slide is historic. That's why I keep repeating it. Pause and review. Next, let's talk about the fetal circulation. What's the purpose of the placenta?  give oxygen and nutrients from mommy to baby and give CO2 and waste from baby to mommy. This is the difference between the adult circulation and the embryological circulation. Here is how the placenta looks. This is the maternal surface and this is the fetal surface. Fetal hemoglobin or hemoglobin F will shift the oxygen dissociation curve to the left and with left shift, the tissue is left behind because oxygen will remain on the hemoglobin and will not go to the  Do you remember the story of the shifters of the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve? With left shift the tissue is left behind. Whose tissue? Mommy's tissue is left behind. You know why? Because this oxygen is gonna go to the hemoglobin F. Because hemoglobin F loves the oxygen so much, i.e. more binding but less dissociation. And this is how the baby takes all the oxygen that it can from mommy.  deficiency, phenytoin, warfarin, thalidomide, all of these are teratogens which can increase risk of congenital anomalies and mutations. Especially during the first trimester of pregnancy because during the first trimester the cells are dividing very rapidly that's why they are the most vulnerable. This is the adult circulation. We go from left ventricle and then all over your body back to right atrium, right ventricle, then give me to the lungs and then gas exchange back to the left atrium.  atrium.  But because the lungs are closed with very high resistant the pulmonary artery said you know what screw it I'm not going to the lungs. I'm gonna bypass the lung. Thank you. Ductus arteriosus And I will dish my blood onto the aorta. What's the fate of these embryological structure after birth? Ductus venosus will become ligamentum venosum foramen ovale will close and become the fossa ovalis ductus arteriosus will become a ligamentum arteriosum the nervous system central and  Pause and review.  sympathetic or enteric nervous system in your gut. A collection of cell bodies in the CNS is a nucleus. A collection of cell bodies in the PNS is a ganglion. A collection of axons in the CNS is a tract. In the PNS it's called a nerve. What's the structural unit of the nervous system? Neuron. How about the functional unit? Reflex arc. Who makes myelin? Well, in the CNS it's the oligodendrocytes, but in the PNS it is Schwann cell. Myelin increased  conduction via saltatory movement. Type A and B nerve fibers are myelinated, but type C fibers are unmyelinated. All your neurons have a neural ML sheath regardless. Why do we need action potential? Because the action potential is life. The nerve impulse in your body is unidirectional. It always go, it always goes in the direction from the soma towards the axon terminalis. The beginning part of the axon is the axon hillock,  And this is the structure of the neuron. Please pause and review. This is the structure of your nerve. Endonurium on the inside, then perinurium, and everything is covered with epinurium. Neurotropins are not the nerve impulse. Nerve impulse is unidirectional. It goes down there. But neurotropins can go by retrograde. Nissl bodies are a very important exam question. This is rough endoplasmic reticulum, and they are found in the neuron.  But not in the axon, please pause and review and this is why myelin is awesome What is the pilot of the nervous system the neuron? How about the co-pilot the co-neurons ie Neuro glial cells the first two will make myelin Astrocyte is for the blood-brain barrier microglia is the macrophage of your nervous system Ependymal cells make the CSF. Do you remember my intermediate filaments? Yeah in the neurons, they are the neurofilaments  But in the glial cells they are the GFAP. Pause and review. If I lose my myelin in the CNS, this is multiple sclerosis. If I lose the myelin in the PNS, this is Guillain-Barre. More about the action potential. During resting state, potassium is leaving. And when the positive leaves, the inside becomes more negative. That's why it's resting, which means inactive. But when sodium decides to enter, sodium is positive. When positive comes in, the inside becomes more positive.  During rest, resting membrane potential. Upon stimulation, action potential. Here's the action potential. During rest, potassium is leaving. That's why the inside is negative. And then upon depolarization, sodium enters. The inside becomes more positive and we are very active. Then we go back to being inactive. This is called repolarization. And if you take it too far, hyperpolarization. Because potassium is leaving and the inside is becoming more negative again.  Who's responsible for the resting membrane state? Selective permeability, i.e. more potassium leaves, then sodium entering. When the positive leaves, the inside becomes more negative. The second thing responsible for the resting membrane potential is the sodium-potassium ATPase pump. Here's the action potential. Please pause and review. Depolarization is sodium entry. Repolarization is potassium efflux. And let's put everything together.  When your neuron is sick and tired of being sick and tired, it's called the refractory period. Which means I cannot get excited again. There is the absolute refractory period with very high standards. I am not gonna be excited again no matter what. But relative refractory period is like, forgive me, is a $2 hooker. I'm not gonna react. I'm not gonna be excited. But if you give me super threshold, too much money, I might give you an action potential.  How do I get the target to get excited?  sub-m and then the muscle will have its own action potential. How does the muscle contract? Well, well, well, the end plate potential will propagate through the T-tubules of the muscle and then calcium will be released. Calcium with a C binds to proponent C and then myosin binds actin G contraction. The comparison between somatic and autonomic is very important. So please pause and review. If this is a ganglion, the fiber before it is pre-ganglionic.  The fiber after is postganglionic. Before it, it's type B fiber. That's why preganglionic are myelinated. But in the postganglionic, we're talking C fibers unmyelinated. Only autonomic fibers have ganglia. The somatic system does not. This is the sympathetic nervous system, thoracolumbar. And this is the parasympathetic system, which is craniosacral. What do you mean by cranio? I mean 1973.  Nerve 7, 9 and 10 are the only cranial nerves that are parasympathetic. This is what happens when you are in fight-flight mode. Pause and review. And this is parasympathetic. Rest and digest. Read, eat and take a dump. Urination defecation. Sympathetic nervous system. When you're running from a tiger, you need to see far ahead. So far vision because my lens is flat. However, if you are parasympathetic gland, you want to read a book. Rest and digest.  eat, read, and take a dump. When you are reading, you need your lens to be spherical. Accommodation.  But parasympathetic will contract the wall, relax the sphincter. Which sphincter? The internal because it's involuntary. Hashtag autonomic. Contrast that with the external which is voluntary. Hashtag somatic. Compare and contrast between sympathetic and parasympathetic. The parasympathetic is always cholinergic. However, the sympathetic starts cholinergic in the preganglionic, but the postganglionic is adrenergic.  system.  and then released by the posterior pituitary.  name of the receptor is V2 and the channel is called aquaporin 2 channel free to choose choose what water only without sodium here is the pituitary again anterior pituitary versus posterior pituitary pause and review  the first thing which is protein anabolic but from the other hormones it borrowed number two and three. It is glycogen catabolic and fat catabolic. Here are the actions of growth hormone. Please pause and review. Thyroid land. Let's make thyroid hormone. Don't forget that we need iodine. What's the key enzyme? Thyroperoxidase. Who's gonna bind tyrosine? Thyroglobulin. Here are the actions of thyroid hormone. Remember it's the stove of your  your body. It increases and boosts metabolism. That's why if you have too much thyroid hormone, everything is working really fast. But if you have hypothyroidism, I am so lazy. Behind the thyroid gland, we have two pairs of glands known as parathyroid glands to make the parathyroid hormone. The parathyroid hormone is procalcium. It increases calcium in the blood. However, it's also a phosphate trashing hormone.  It decreases serum phosphate. Calcitonin hates everybody so lowers your calcium and phosphate. Vitamin D3 has a brain. I can increase serum calcium just like PTH. However, I noticed that both of them are trashing phosphate which is dangerous because you need adenosine triphosphate which is ATP. So I'm gonna raise serum phosphate. Adrenal cortex versus adrenal medulla. The cortex will make aldosterone, cortisol,  Adrenal androgens. The medulla will make catecholamines including dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine. What's the function of aldosterone made by the zona glomerulosa? It reabsorbs two things and dumps two things into the urine. Glucocorticoids want to boost glucose via gluconeogenesis. Adrenal androgens are androgens. Don't you ever forget the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone cyst. The kidney makes renin which converts  to  Adrenal Cortex vs. Medulla Pause and Review  from the alpha cells. Insulin is anabolic. It builds up protein from amino acid. It builds up glycogen from glucose. It builds up triglycerides from free fatty acid. But glucagon is a destroyer. That's why it goes in the opposite direction. That's why when you're feeding, it's time to build up. You need insulin. But when you're fasting, it's time to break down and get some energy. You need glucagon. Alpha cell for glucagon, beta cell for insulin, and  Delta cell is the doofus somatostatin because it inhibits everything. Do you remember reproduction? Pause and review. Do you remember this? Pause and review. More hints about endocrine. Pineal glands make melatonin important for circadian rhythm. The kidney makes EPO which goes to the bone marrow to boost red blood cell production. When the heart gets stretched out because I have volume overload or heart failure, I secrete ANP or BNP.  It's time to breathe. Here's the anatomy of the respiratory system. Please remember that you have a conducting zone and a respiratory zone. Here are the functions of each part of your respiratory tract. Here's a comparison between conducting zone and respiratory zone.  If air pressure is higher in California than Arizona, then wind will blow from California to Arizona from high pressure to low pressure. Review Boyle law, which means volume and pressure hate each other. If one is going up, the other is going down, provided that temperature remains constant. When I'm trying to breathe in, I expand my chest. Volume goes up, pressure goes down. I have a more negative pressure inside. Therefore, I'm going to suck air in.  because negative pressures pull in stuff. The exact opposite happens during expiration. You breathe air in from the atmosphere, it goes to your lungs, then it goes to your arterial blood, in the beginning free and dissolved, then it jumps on the hemoglobin, the cell will use it, and then you get the CO2 back to the hemoglobin and the lung will breathe it out for you. Surface tension is dangerous. It wants your lungs to collapse and recoil, but thankfully you have a  Here are the pulmonary function tests. Please pause and review. Lung volumes are here. Lung capacities are here.  and carbon dioxide which is technically an acid because it combines with water and give you carbonic acid. Who will get rid of this volatile acid? The lungs. Who's gonna get rid of these non-volatile or fixed acids? The kidneys. If you metabolize more, you will end up with more acids. If you breathe more, hyperventilation will lower your carbon dioxide in the blood. Conversely, hypoventilation will raise the carbon dioxide in your blood.  Please pause and review Le Chatelier's principle.  is  which includes oxygen, went down.  the temperature of my right arm and increasing glycolysis and therefore 2-3 BPG. When all of them go up, I will shift to the right. With right shift, there is giving of the oxygen to the tissue, which means oxygen is leaving the hemoglobin and going to the tissue. The exact opposite happens with left shift. With left shift, the tissue is left behind because oxygen is remaining on the hemoglobin and away from the tissue. Here's the effect of high altitude on your body.  Please pause and review. When I go on top of the mountain I get hypoxia and my body will respond. I shifted my oxygen dissociation curve to the right and the tissue is happy with more oxygen. Since there is less oxygen pressure upstairs I will breathe more. Therefore carbon dioxide in my blood will decrease because of the hyperventilation and the pH will go up. We call this respiratory alkalosis. Cardio time. Here is the adult circulation.  Here are the four valves in the heart. All of them are tricuspid, i.e. with three cusps, except the mitral which only has two cusps. Do veins have valves? Yes. How about arteries? No. Please remember that the cardiac muscles are striated, involuntary, uninucleated, and branching with lots and lots of gap junction. The gap junction is very important for your heart because it allows the entire heart to contract as a one singular unit.  Here's the SA node and the AV node. That's why your heart is automatic. Sympathetic and parasympathetic are not initiators. They are just regulators. Between the first heart sound and the second heart sound, it's called systole because your ventricles are contracting. Between the second heart sound and the following  First heart sound it's called diastole because your ventricles are relaxing cardiac output is heart rate times the stroke volume the productivity of your heart is based on how fast times how strong your heart is beating the pressure inside big vessels is 120 during systole and 80 during diastole but in the left ventricle It's 120 during systole same but almost zero during diastole then how come the aorta was 80?  Not zero during diastole. It's thanks to clamping down on that blood and this is why you get the diacritic notch That's how the aorta prevented your pressure from dropping to zero during diastole Unlike the left vent. Let's talk about volume of blood in the left ventricle when the ventricle is squeezing itself and pushing the blood out Less blood will be left in the ventricle. You go down like but when the ventricle is relaxing and receiving blood the volume of blood  in the left ventricle will go up. Put everything together in one shot and you get the lovely cardiac cycle. You need to understand everything here. Let's talk about capillaries. There is arterial end and venous end. Each vessel is made of tunica intima, tunica media, tunica adventitia. Contrast and compare among arteries, veins, and capillaries, please. These are the different types of arteries, different types of veins, and different types of capillaries in your body. Some pro tip.  vasodilate you'll increase the radius and the diameter of the vessel. Therefore the resistance goes down, the afterload goes down, the blood pressure goes down. Remember the metaterial please. And remember that we have pushing forces, hydrostatic pressure, thank you, blood volume. And we have pulling forces, oncotic pressure, thank you, albumin, which is a plasma protein. If I want to feed my cell, i.e. I want the blood to go this way from  the capillary to the cell. Therefore, the favoring forces should exceed the opposing forces. What are your favoring forces here? Hydrostatic pressure in the capillary and oncotic pressure in the interstitial fluid. What are your opposing forces? Oncotic pressure in the capillary, because it pulls this way, and hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial. And then you do it this way. Favoring forces minus opposing forces. If the end result is a positive number, it means  That you are pushing fluid out of the capillary and to the cell. Let's talk about blood cells and plasma As you know, your blood is made of plasma and cells These cells are red blood cells white blood cells and platelets But the plasma is water and proteins could be albumin proteins or globulin proteins Which one is responsible for the oncotic pressure albumin? Which one will give you coagulation factors and your antibodies? Globulin, these are your blood cells. Please pause and review  Red blood cells are circular biconcave non-nucleated. They do not have a mitochondrion. Therefore, there is no Krebs cycle, no electron transport chain in the red blood cell. The only source of energy for the red blood cell is glycolysis, basically. Next, white blood cells. Why do we have neutrophils? They fight bacteria and they are the cells of acute inflammation. Why lymphocytes? They fight viruses and fungi and they are the cells of chronic inflammation. How about monocytes? They become macrophages which are phagocytes.  Eosinophils fight parasites and allergy. Remember eosinophils? Eww! How about basophils? They release histamine. Platelets or the thrombocytes, they help you make a clot to stop the bleeding. How do you stop the bleeding? First you vasoconstrict, then the platelets will help you in primary hemostasis. Then the coagulation factors, i.e. beta globulins, will help you. This is secondary hemostasis. Here is primary hemostasis.  Hemostasis, thank you platelets. Here is secondary hemostasis. Thank you coagulation factors. Next on the surface of your red blood cell We have the ABO antigen system and we have the Rh antigen system. You only have two antigens by the way A and B. Well, how about O then? O means zero. Oh, you have neither A nor B. That's why we call you O. Please pause and review. Don't forget the blood typing and blood matching which we have discussed before. Next  Immunity  making plasma cells which will secrete antibodies. You have IgM, IgA, IgG, IgE, and IgG. All of them are gamma globulins. Each of these antibodies has heavy chains and light chains. When something invades your body, you take a piece called an antigen. Then the antigen presenting cell will present that antigen to the lymphocyte. The lymphocytes can destroy that microbe. If it's a B lymphocyte, it will grow and become plasma cells to make antibodies.  and more importantly, you will develop memory so that the second exposure is faster and stronger. Here is a comparison between hemoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity. Here are your lymph nodes. Remember, there is the police academy. For the B lymphocytes, it's the bone marrow. For the T lymphocytes, it's the thymus. Then we have police officers. These are the lymphocytes. Then we have police stations. These are the lymphatic organs. Here is the lymph node. It has a cortex. It has a medulla. And in between,  a paracortex. The cortex is for the B lymphocytes. Paracortex is for the T lymphocytes. And then the medulla with the medullary sinus is for plasma cells and macrophages. Compare and contrast. And again. And one more time. Next, digestion. Digestion is to break down the macro into the micro. And then you are able to absorb the micro and send it to blood. The liver will metabolize it. If you could not digest it and absorb it, you will  end up pooping it. Your gut has a wall and a lumen. The wall is made of mucosa, submucosa, musculosis, cirrhosis. Digestion could be mechanical by motility or chemical by secretions. Motility is by the myenteric plexus. Secretion is with the submucosal plexus. You have lots of glands in the GI. Part of them are just part of the elementary canal. Others are outside or accessory glands. Here's the anatomy of the digestive system.  Now let's talk about the function from head to toe. In the mouth there is mechanical called mastication and chemical digestion called salivation. The enzyme is amylase. The function is carbohydrate digestion. Next send the food to the pharynx and then the esophagus and then the stomach. The stomach has mechanical which is motility and chemical which is secretion. You need to memorize every cell in the stomach and what it makes. GI hormones include gastrin which is made by the G cell, the only hormone.  that is pro-stomach, increases motility and secretion of the stomach. C-cretin is secreted by the S-cells in the upper part of small intestine. C-cretin tells the pancreatic ducts to make lots of water and bicarb to neutralize the acidity. CCK, cholecystokinin pancreasimine. It's called cholecystokinin because it squeezes the gallbladder. It's called pancreasimine because it increases the release of pancreatic digestive enzymes from the S in our cells.  Somatostatin is the doofus from the delta cell. Why doofus? Because it inhibits everything. It even inhibits its own secretion. In order for you to digest and absorb the fat and the fat-soluble vitamin, you need three organs to be healthy. Liver and biliary system, pancreas, and the gut. After you digest, what do you do? You absorb. What if you could not absorb? Then you excrete. If you happen to be water-soluble, you will go the blood route.  fat-soluble, you'll go through the lymph route. And this is true for vitamins. If you are water-soluble vitamin, blood route. If you are lipid-soluble vitamin, lymph route. Here is all of digestion in one slide. Here is how we digest carbohydrates. Here is how we digest proteins. And here is how we digest fat. Next, kidney. Please review your anatomy and the physiology of the kidney.  or  How do we move based on what?  The epidermis of your skin came from the ectoderm, but the dermis is derived from the mesoderm.  for thermoregulation, please pause and review.  Please pause and review.  Contraction is sliding of myosin and actin. Myosin is going to extend those cross bridges and pull actin towards the midline. Skeletal muscles have nicotinic receptors. Smooth muscles have muscarinic or adrenergic receptors. How about cardiac muscles? Similar to smooth muscles. This is the neuromuscular transmission again. Please pause and review.  Let's compare between type 1 muscle fibers and type 2 fibers.  metabolism of the muscle  gives you a net of 38 ATP molecules. After exercise, the muscle and the lung made a deal. Hey, hey, hey, I'm the muscle. I need 500 ml to complete that marathon, but I can only give 400 right now. Okay, here is a deal. You can give me the 400 right now, but then after I finish exercise, you owe me a hundred. Bet. That's the oxygen debt. And that's why you're hyperventilating even after you finish the marathon.  Why are you doing this? The lung is paying back her debt.  We have the shaft. We have epiphysis, we have diaphysis, and we have metaphysis in between. Your bone could be compact, especially on the outside, or spongy, especially in the middle, near the medulla, near the bone marrow. Osteoblasts will build up your bone, but osteoclasts will cut down bone. Your bone is basically matrix, thank you, collagen, and minerals, thank you, calcium and phosphate.  Bones have type 1 collagen, but type 2 collagen is in cartilage. Please review your haversian system. And here is a distinction between bone and cartilage. Type 1 vs type 2, vascular vs avascular. When two bones are ready to meet each other, it's a joint. And you have some lovely fluid for lubrication. And there are three types of joints in your body.  And here are the laws of Gregor Mendel.  explains the second law of Mendel. All the alleles in a given population of people is called the gene pole. Can we have mutations? Of course! We can have mutations affecting the nucleotide or a mutation affecting the entire chromosome. Please pause and review. Do not forget that missense is sickle cell disease. Nonsense will give you a stop codon. Stop the nonsense! You need to draw tons of Punnett squares before your exam. This is the result  when you have one autosomal dominant parent and another autosomal recessive parent and both are homozygous. This is the result. Let's take that first generation and marry them with another person from the first generation and what do you get right now? You get a different ratio as you see. And this was called the mono-hybrid cross because we're talking about just one characteristic which is their color. But what if we're talking about two things? Their color and their height? Then it's going to be the dihybrid cross.  with a different ratio. Please pause and review. This is the result of sex-linked crosses. We can map genes and chromosomes and get their recombination frequency which is proportional to the distance between two genes on a freaking chromosome. Using this theta or recombination frequency you can deduce the order of genes on a chromosome and we talked about this before. Hardy-Weinberg equation. It's not hard, you just need to memorize two  equations. More importantly, you need to understand what each letter refer to. For example, the P alone is the frequency of the dominant allele in a population, but the P squared is talking about an individual in that population. P alone is the tall allele. P squared is a tall individual. And here is an example that we did before. Just by giving you the first number, which is 70%, you can deduce all of the rest. Please pause.  and review and do it yourself.  zygotic which allows a zygote to be formed. However, it's gonna be non-viable or sterile. An exam question will ask you about the mule. The mule is an example of hybrid sterility which is a post-zygotic isolation. Pattern of evolution are many. We have divergent, parallel and convergent. We did it! You can download my notes at medicosisperfictionalist.com. They have extra points than we discussed in this video and you can  download my surgery high yields course if you are interested.

        "text": " Hello champs, good evening. I hope you all are fine.  Can you hear me properly? Can you hear me properly? Is am I properly visible to you? Okay. Students have already joined. Very good evening. Very good evening.  Ray R. Ray yes good evening beta good evening Sarita Mahanti is ok Sarita is also there ok fine Kritika Premjit Ghosh is there Om Prakash is there ok fine fine fine I hope you all are fine so without wasting time let's start then and before that let me tell you one thing that you have to answer as fast as possible ok  If you take less time to answer then it will be beneficial to you.  join  Yes, Solanki beta, yes, good evening, very good evening. Hardly one hour or one hour and 50 minutes maximum. 25 questions, Ramesh, 25 questions. Okay, so 41 students have joined, 42, okay, let me wait for some time. Yes, Nishta, okay Nishta, yes, hi beta, hi, hi.  you  Just 30 seconds we will wait and then we will start again.  players have joined 74, 75, 78 students have joined. So, this is the first question. This is your first question which says the concept of omniscellular cellular regarding cell division was first proposed by. Time starts now.  The concept of Omni-cellular is cellular which is also known as principle of cell lineage.  83  is  on your screen. Which of the following statements about inclusion body is incorrect? The options are there. The code is 80803479. Deepak, 80803479.  8 seconds quick  the  membrane.  So, the third question. Select the wrong statement. You have to find out the wrong statement.  you have to find out the wrong statement okay wrong statement 10 seconds 3 2 times up so let us see okay  a  acid and an acetylglucosamine.  it  to  Pili and Pimri are not at all associated with any kind of mortality.  of  So, let us move to the next question then. So, here is your fourth question. Which of the following structures is not found in a prokaryotic cell?  very  7 students have answered right correctly. 10 students said plasma membrane and 9 students said mesosome.  So,  the next question is on your screen  The structures that help some bacteria to attach to the rocks and or host tissues are the structures which are associated with attachment with rocks or the host tissue. Mesosome holdfast rhizoid sphincter.  10 seconds 10 seconds okay these are very simple questions 3 2 time's up time's up okay so let's see okay 78 students yes very nice you have answered correctly okay risers they are not associated risers are basically root like structures which are found in the  of  about  So let us see the next question then. So here is your question. Which of one of the following is not an inclusion body found in progress? Not an inclusion body.  18 seconds 18 seconds don't answer incorrectly ok think before answering ok times up times  playing very well but still 16 students they said glycogen granule, no. That is an example of what? Inclusion body. Phosphate granule is also an inclusion body and cyanophase granule that is also an example of inclusion body. But polysome is not an example of inclusion body. So you may ask me sir what is polysome? So let me tell you what is polysome?  see in case of prokaryotes because this life cycle of the prokaryote or the duration of the lifespan of the prokaryote is very very small that is why the prokaryote has to produce a number of proteins a large number of proteins in a short time period and to achieve this what happens the single mRNA the single mRNA will get bound to a number of ribosomes. Okay so suppose this is one ribosome suppose this is one ribosome  Suppose, this is one ribosome.  this was the third ribosome and all those ribosomes they will bind at this point at the 5 prime end and they will move towards the 3 prime end. So, like this they will bind at the 5 prime end and they will move towards the 3 prime end. So, these are the ribosomes what type of ribosomes 70s ribosome and while moving while moving they will produce the mRNA. So, they will produce the polypeptide chain. So, it will produce the just a minute. So, this is the polypeptide chain  And this is also a polypeptide chain. This is also a polypeptide chain. This is also a polypeptide chain and this is the polypeptide chain. So, you can see a number of polypeptide chains are synthesized from the single mRNA from the single mRNA molecule and this complex of a single mRNA which is bound with a number of ribosomes 70th type of ribosome is called as polyribosome and this is the feature of prokaryotes. This is a feature of prokaryotes.  so lets check the leaderboard then ok lets check lets see sorry ok aditya very nice very nice sahani also very nice ok so you both are the fastest one very good very good  So  So here is your question which structure performs the function of mitochondria in bacteria mitochondrial function in bacteria which structure nucleoid ribosome ok cell wall and mesosome 24 seconds very simple question very simple question  Okay, time's up time's up. So see let's see Okay, very nice 78 students. You have answered absolutely correctly. Okay, very nice, but still some students  to  in  are  a  is  And remember one thing the flagella in prokaryote and the flagella in eukaryote they are structurally different. The flagella in prokaryote is made up of plagiolin protein whereas the flagella in the eukaryote that is made up of tubulin protein microtubules. And no doubt the prokaryotes they can have membrane, flagella and pili but among these three only the flagella will help in mortality of the bacteria. So, the correct answer will be flagella.  so  Let us look at the question number 9. So, the question number 9 is on your screen. Why is a capsule advantageous to a bacterium? What is the advantage of capsule for a bacteria?  Mohamed Ibrahim from Arjuna batch  answer is it allows bacterium to hide from host immune system.  to  So, it  water  prevent the loss of further that is why this is not responsible for prevention of desiccation. And why not D? It allows the bacteria to attach to the surface. No, because the capsule will not help the bacteria to get attached. The structure which will help in attachment is your what? Fembrane.  once again very nice so who was the first fastest to answer okay aditya very nice very nice okay fine fine sorav apurva hitesh very nice very nice earthman you are also playing very nice okay harsh baghel okay very nice you are improving your score very nice very nice okay so now the question number 10 is  on your screen. The term glycocalyx is used for. Ok Hare Krishna you are from Tamil Nadu. Ok very nice. I was also there in Tamil Nadu. Not Tamil Nadu but I was in Pondicherry.  XVIRU  3 components which are tightly bound to each other. And what is the outermost structure or component of the bacterial cell envelope? The outermost one is the glycocalyx and the middle one is the cell wall and the innermost one is the plasma membrane. So, I will say the glycocalyx is the outermost one and it is outer to what? Outer to the cell wall. So, this the answer will be A.  Rajasthani  to  11. Which is the important site for formation of glycoproteins and glycolipids in eukaryotic cells?  Madhya Pradesh students from different states have joined.  is  If I write glycoprotein and suppose I write proteoglycan, see both these terms, both  In both of these cases, protein and carbohydrate are present.  protein and glycan means polysaccharide is present that means carbohydrate is present. But among between these two which one is the major component it is the carbohydrate glycan is the major component that means carbohydrate is the major component and the minor component is the protein. But in the second case here also I have carbohydrate as well as protein but in this case protein is the major component that means the second word is will be the will be the major component.  and the first one will be the minor component.  be  we have 12th number question quick info  Which statement is not correct?  form  Okay, very nice, very nice.  Which of the following statements regarding mitochondria is incorrect?  So, the answer is enzymes of electron transport are embedded in outer membrane. No, the enzymes of electron transport system they are present in the inner mitochondrial membrane not outer mitochondrial membrane. In case of prokaryote the enzymes of the ETAs are present in the plasma membrane.  in the plasma membrane.  14. The shorter and longer arms of submetacentric chromosomes are referred to as MNN, SMI, PNQ, QNP.  So, 17 seconds very simple question this is information based question. Time's up. See when we talk about the sub metacentric chromosome it will have 2 unequal arms one will be longer arm and another one will be shorter.  shorter one. And the longer arm is called is represented by q and this smaller one or this shorter one is represented by p. So, the shorter one will be p and the longer one will be q. So, this is one information based question. So, let us check. And this question was asked in the NEET exam.  nice very nice very nice okay you are the fastest to answer this question okay so let us see the next question then. Which of the following pairs of organelles does not contain DNA? Organelles not containing DNA.  By whatever I have done, you please visit www.menti.com and then use the code 80803479.  to  Who was the fastest to answer this question? Okay Okay, so Kriti very nice very nice better very nice Sneha a poor wa that upon harsh wiggle, okay, very nice very nice You all are playing well. So let's see the next question 16 number question  Xv Ru okay, which of the following is true for nucleus, nucleus, true for nucleus okay.  So, 61 students you have answered correctly ok very nice. Let me explain you this question.  suppose  RNA molecules and these RNA molecules will bind with the protein molecules to form the ribosomal subunits. So, I can say this nucleus is the active site of what our RNA formation. So, the answer is D. So, let us see who was the fastest to answer this question. Sourav, you also came into play.  Darpan, Harsh Vaghel, Power, Aditya, very nice beta, very nice, very nice, Tarla, okay fine. So, question number 17, the Golgi complex participates in that means the function of Golgi body, participates in fatty acid breakdown, formation of secretory vesicles, respiration in bacteria, activation of amino acids.  5 seconds, 4 seconds, 2, 1. Time is up.  So, the correct answer is formation of secretive vesicles.  are  membrane it will release its content outside the cell. So, this was the answer. Now, let us check the leaderboard then. So far you are doing very well. So, let us see Tushar very nice. Sarla, Sourav, Harsh Bagel, Sukrithi, Shani. You all are playing well.  So, let us see the next question then. Question number 18. Which of the following events does not occur in the rough endoplasmic  one student is from Bangladesh ok welcome welcome no this is English channel so I cannot speak in Hindi ok  8 students you have answered correctly. See the proteins which are synthesized are basically polypeptide chains and the polypeptide chains they are folded by the help of special proteins which are present in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum RER and that special protein is chaperone. And it will in the endoplasmic reticulum rough endoplasmic reticulum the protein will be added with some sugar molecules that will form that and the process is called as glycosylation  the  19. Incorrect match  the  the  So, the just a minute just a minute just a minute okay and the option D the option D was talking about polytene chromosome in the O side of the in the O side okay but polytene chromosomes are not present in the O side. In the O side which chromosomes are found it is the lamp brush chromosome which chromosome lamp brush chromosome okay.  So, in oocyte which chromosome should found? Lembrus chromosome. So, where do you find the polytene chromosome in this salivary gland cells of the insects like Drosophila or Scironomus? So, the answer will be D. So, let us see who answered this correctly and fastest.  the  simple question, very simple question.  So,  used  is  So, let us see the next question then 21 number question mismatch mismatch okay gas vehicle green bacteria large central vehicle animal cells protists eukaryotes  15 seconds  and  They are present in photosynthetic prokaryotes. So, the green bacteria is an example of what photosynthetic prokaryotes. So, it will have gas vehicle and the protease, all the members of protease, they have eukaryotic cells. So, they belong to eukaryotes and methanogens, they produce methane and they belong to the prokaryotes. They belong to archaebacteria, which is a member of what, which is a group of prokaryotes. So, let us see who has answered fastest.  So, let us see the next question then. So, here is your question number 22. Only 4 questions left.  organelles containing hydrolytic enzymes lysosome, microsome, ribosome, mesosome.  4, 3, 2 times up ok. See the organelle which contains hydrolytic enzymes that is the lysosome and apart from lysosome in case of plant cells some spurosomes they also may have they may have hydrolytic enzymes and that is why we call spurosome as plant lysosome.  It is not necessary that every time the spirosome will have the hydrolytic enzymes, no. But in some cases, the spirosome also contains hydrolytic enzymes and that is why we call that as plant lysosome. Why? Because spirosome is found only in plants, not in animals. Okay. And what is spirosome? Spirosome is basically a micro body. Okay. That is a micro body. Okay. So the answer is A. Okay. So see, let us see. This was very simple question, right? Okay.  23. Only 3 questions left.  is  So, when I talk about mitochondrial clover past, they have DNA and because they have DNA, they will undergo transcription to produce the RNA molecules and the RNA molecules specifically the mRNA will undergo translation to produce the proteins.  and  mitochondria  and  the  Now, the question number 24, the second last question, second last question okay. So, try to improve your marks, core okay. Microtubules are constituent of or microtubules are part of what? Centrial spindle fiber, chromatin, centrosome, nucleosome, centriole, cilia, flagella and peroxisome and spindle fiber, centriole and cilia.  the  So, 38 students only 38 students you have answered correctly. Let me explain you.  micro  Hello is the you are the only one new ok fine. So Aditya ok very nice beta very nice very nice ok fine. Ok so the next question let us see the next question then. This is which one of the following cell organelles is enclosed by single membrane organelle having one membrane single membrane bound organelle.  mitochondria chloroplast. 26 seconds. Very simple question. Very simple question. Okay, Joy, you have to go to www.menti.com and you have to use the code 80803479. Okay? It is almost done. It is almost done.  So, 93 students you said lysosome very nice nuclei is nothing but the plural form of nucleus and nucleus will have 2 membranes mitochondria chloroplast they also have 2 membranes. The only 3 organelles which are double membrane bound they are nucleus mitochondria and plastid all the 3 plastids whether the plastid is chloroplast, leukoplast or chromoplast does not matter everyone will have the 2 membranes. So, the answer is lysosome.  was the fastest to answer?  all the other students who played this I will congratulate you also why not because you won you lost but because you attempted ok and many students they because this is Sunday so they will be roaming here and there they will be watching movies ok but you came here to participate and that is why I will congratulate you ok and because you participated that means this is an indication or sign of  your seriousness towards your study very nice very nice ok. So, thank you so much everyone thank you so much take care and we will meet in the next class ok next class spell cycle and cell division ok. Thank you take care bye.  you "

        "text": " All right. It's 11.05. I'm going to try to start promptly at 11.05 each time. So welcome. Is everybody psyched? I'm psyched. This is 9.13, The Human Brain. I'm Nancy Kanwisher. I'm the prof for this class. And lest you were wondering, I have a brain. And there it is. That's me.  with some bits colored in that you will learn about in this class. What I'm going to do today is I'm going to tell you a brief story for around 10 minutes. And then I'm going to talk about the why, how, and what of studying the human brain, why it's a cool thing to do, how you do it, and what in particular we're going to learn about in here. And then we'll do some mechanics and details of the course and allocation of grades and all that. It's on the syllabus anyway. Cool? That's the agenda.  All right. So let's start with that story. And for this, I'm going to sit up here. The story isn't that long, but it has a lot of interesting little weird bits. So I have cue cards to remind myself of all the bits I want to remember to say. So you can put away your phones and your computers, and you don't need to take notes. This is just a story. It's going to foreshadow a lot of the themes in the course, but it's not stuff you're going to be tested on.  So this is a true story. And I've changed only a few tiny little bits to protect the identity of the people involved. But otherwise, it's an absolutely true story. It's a story about a scary medical situation that happened to a friend of mine a few years ago. But at the same time, it's a story about the nature of the human mind, about the organization of the human brain.  And it's also a story about the ability, or lack thereof, to recover after brain damage. It's also, incidentally, a story about resilience, privilege, expertise, and all of those things that are characteristic of many people in Cambridge society. Not so relevant for the course, but all right, here goes.  ago, a friend of mine was staying over at my house in Cambridge en route to a conference in a nearby state. And this guy, I'll call him Bob, was a close friend of mine. I'd known him for years and years. We talked regularly. We went on hiking trips together. We were pretty close. So he's en route to this conference. He's staying over at my house the night before. And the plan was for him to get up early the next morning and drive to the conference.  So we hung out the night before and chatted. And the next morning, he's sleeping in the next room over from mine. And early in the morning, I hear some shuffling. I think, yep, OK, Bob is packing to leave. And thank God I don't need to get up. I'm only dimly awake. And so I'm not paying that much attention. Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle in the background. And then I hear a crash. And I think, what the hell is that?  and I go into the next room and Bob is lying on the floor, not moving. I say, Bob, and there's no answer. And then I shout, Bob, and there's no answer. And then I dialed 911. While we were sitting there waiting for the ambulance to arrive, Bob starts to wake up. And he's very woozy, but he's alive and he's making a little bit of sense. And he can't figure out what's going on.  on and neither can I. And so we're talking and chatting and he's making a little more sense, but we still don't know what's happening. So then the ambulance arrives incredibly fast. It felt like three minutes, boom. There's three EMTs rushing in the front door, rushing up to the room where Bob was, and they take all his vitals and they can't find anything wrong. And so they're really casual. I guess they confront stuff like this all the time. I don't.  Bob doesn't, but they're very calm about it. And they're saying, well, you can take him to the hospital or not. And I was like, I think we need to know what just happened. Even though he seems okay, we kind of need to know what this is all about, don't you think? They're like, yeah, you can take him to the ER. And I said, well, do we need to waste ambulance resources or do you think it's safe if I drive him myself since there's a hospital not far away? They said, you can drive him yourself. So I drive Bob to the Mount Auburn  Auburn Hospital ER, which is like less than a mile from my house. And we do the usual ER thing, which is mostly waiting and waiting and waiting. But various docs come by and they take all these tests and they take all these history questions and it goes on and on. And basically they're just not finding anything. So after about an hour or two of this, they're still doing tests. They don't want to quite let him go yet because they don't know what happened. Everybody's calm about it. I figure, OK, fine, I got work to do. And I tell  Bob, you know, text me throughout the day and I'll come get you whenever they're ready to release you. And so I go into work. But just before I go into work, a thought flashes through my mind and I say to the ER doc, you know, you should check Bob's brain. And the reason that thought flashed through my mind is that actually I had been worrying about Bob for a number of years and I hadn't really  It hadn't quite registered consciously. It was kind of too horrifying a thought for me to really allow myself to realize I was worried about Bob's brain. But I was worried about a very particular thing, and that is that Bob had been showing these weird signs that he often got lost and didn't know where he was. And on the one hand, this just didn't make any sense, because he was fine in every other way. But it was really pretty striking. So one time, I was over at Bob's house with some  other friends of ours. And the friend asked Bob, how do we get, how do I drive from your house into Cambridge? And Bob said, well, you go to the end of the driveway and you turn left. My friend and I looked at each other like, Bob, what? And Bob thinks about it for minutes. Yeah. End of the driveway, turn left. I just had this like sinking feeling of dread in the pit of my stomach. But we sort of made light of it and made fun of it. And it went by.  was like, no, you turn right. And we gave the directions. Another time, a friend of mine was driving with Bob in Bob's hometown and noticed that Bob didn't seem to know how to get to the grocery store in his hometown where he'd lived for a really long time and a trip he'd made hundreds of times. Another time, I was at a conference in Germany and I saw these arrays of posters of people presenting  and I was running usually pretty dry scientific things, and out of the corner of my eye, I see the title of a poster, and it says, navigational deficits colon an early sign of Alzheimer's. And I saw that, and I just thought, oh! And I just kind of suppressed the thought. I thought, oh my god, Bob wasn't that old. I know Alzheimer's can very rarely strike early. I just, I didn't want to think about it, but it was like rattling around in the back of my consciousness.  these signs. But as I say, they didn't make sense because Bob was holding down a very high-powered job. He was writing beautiful prose. He was the life of every party he was at, witty, funny, everybody's favorite life of the party. So how could that be? It just didn't make sense that there would be anything wrong with Bob's brain. So I managed for a few years to notice these signs and ignore them and not pay any attention.  So the killer thing is I should have known better. My research for the last 20 years has been on the very fact that there are different parts of the brain that do different things. And one of the corollaries of that is you can have a problem with one of those parts and the other parts can work just fine. And so I, if anyone, should have realized, yes, there's something  really wrong with Bob's navigation abilities. And the fact that he's smart and witty and funny and holding down a high-powered job doesn't mean there isn't something wrong with his brain, with a part of his brain. But I didn't realize that. But then, as I'm leaving the ER, it kind of all clicked. And I said to the ER doc, you better check his brain. I thought Bob was out of earshot when I said that. He heard it. He's like, what?  I was like, oh, never mind. Anyway, the ER doc, with the kind of confidence that only docs can muster, said, no, not a brain thing. This is a heart thing, which wasn't exactly reassuring. But I set aside the brain thought, and I went off to work. So throughout the day, I texted with Bob a few times. Things seemed to be fine. They'd done more tests.  They weren't finding anything. We just got calmer and calmer about it. I guess sometimes weird stuff happens and you just move on. But then that night, around seven or eight at night, I was over at a friend's house and the phone rang. And it was Bob. I picked it up and Bob says, get over here. They found something in my brain. So I ran out of the house, grabbed my phone. And as I'm driving to the Mount Auburn ER,  I called my trusty lab tech, an amazing guy who keeps track of all kinds of things much better than I do, and I said, I remember that we scanned Bob a bunch of years ago for a regular experiment in my lab. And I don't remember the date. I don't remember anything about it. But dig around in the files and see if you can figure it out. It might be useful to have that scan. So by the time I get to the ER, my lab tech is already  texted me back and said, found the scans. I'm putting them in a Dropbox for you. So I go into the ER, and there's Bob in the ER doc. And Bob says to me, do you want to see it? The ER doc, the radiologist, has already shown Bob the picture of his brain. And so they take me in there. And I look at it. And I gulped. There was a thing the size of a lime smack in the middle of his brain.  Pretty terrifying. So this lime in the middle of Bob's brain was right next to a region that my lab had studied in great detail. In fact, my lab had discovered that a brain region right next to where that lime was located was specifically involved in navigation. How could I not have put all this together?  didn't until that moment. And I thought, of course, of course there's a thing in his brain right next to the parahippocampal place area, which I discovered, and a nearby related region called retrosplenial cortex, of course. And how the hell could I not have known? But I didn't know. In that earlier work, it had been nearly 20 years ago, I had a postdoc named Russell Epstein. And Russell was a computer vision guy, and he wanted to understand how we  we see by writing code to duplicate the algorithms that he thought go on in the human brain when we understand visual images. And that's a very respectable, cool line of work, which we'll learn a little bit about in here. And Russell was really a coding guy. At the time, we were just starting doing brain imaging. But Russell was like poo-pooing it all. It's like the flash in the pan. It's going to go by. It's trashy. So you guys get nice blobs on the brain. I'm not having any of it. And I kept saying, Russell, you need to get a job.  job, just do one experiment so you can show in your job talk that you can do brain imaging. It might help you. You don't need to do a lot of it. Just do one dumb experiment. Russell was interested in how we recognize scenes, not just objects and faces and words, but how do we know where we are and how do we recognize if the scene is a city or a beach or whatever it is. I said, OK, Russell, we'll just scan people looking at pictures of scenes and looking at other kinds of pictures, and we'll just kind of see if there's any part of  brain that responds a lot to scenes. It really was not well thought out. This is not how you should do an experiment. It shouldn't be based on political calculations, lack of theory, any of the above. But the fact is, that's why we did that experiment. Russell needed to be able to show a brain image in his job talk. So we scanned some people looking at scenes. And the results knocked our socks off. We found a part of the brain that responds very selectively when you look at images of scenes, not when you look at faces, objects, words, or pretty much anything.  anything else. And so we'll learn more about that later in the course. We called it the parahippocampal place area, and that launched a whole major line of work in my lab and now dozens of other labs around the world. So backtrack. We'd already found that region, and here's this Lyme in my friend Bob's brain sitting right next to the parahippocampal place area. OK. So then I remember  And so I figured, let's look at the scans from my lab from a few years ago in Bob's brain. And so I fiddled around and managed to download the files. And there it was. You could see that same blob. But in the scans from a few years before, it was much smaller. It was the size of a grape. And so that told us a bunch of things. Most importantly, it told us this thing is growing really slowly.  important because brain tumors are very bad news and they usually grow really fast. And the fact that it grew really slowly told us that this was not one of the kind of worst, most invasive, most horrible ones. It was clearly a problem. It was big, but at least it wasn't growing hugely fast. But how poignant that there it was in my own damn data and I hadn't seen it in my friend's brain. Well, I'm not a radiologist.  I'm a basic researcher, and I didn't look, and I didn't see it. So indeed, the next day, the docs told us that they thought this was meningioma, not cancer. Who knew that you could have tumors that weren't cancer, but you can? And they still need to come out if they're big enough, and that's very serious, but it's not as bad as having a cancer in your brain. So as we're collecting information, the next day I'm hanging out in the hospital room, and there was an amusing moment  when one of the residents came by and he's taking the history and asking all the basic questions and I said kind of sheepishly, because you don't want to seem like you know more than the residents, and in fact I didn't really know more, but I just thought I'd provide a little information. I said, you know, he's actually had symptoms for a bunch of years and there's a region of the brain nearby that I've actually studied a little bit. And the resident says, we know who you are. So much for my trying to be a good  I'm trying to stay under the radar. That afternoon, I talked to a neurosurgeon friend of mine, because I figured, OK, we need advice. We need help. And the neurosurgeon friend said, quote, it got branded in my brain, she said, it is of paramount importance that you find the best neurosurgeon. It's the difference between whether Bob dies on the table or goes on to live a normal life. So this is the privilege part.  of the story. I'm not that well connected, but I'm a little bit connected and I kind of dug around and did what I could and we spent a couple of weeks and we found the best neurosurgeon. And the night before the surgery, Bob is staying over at my house because the surgery was in a Boston hospital and I thought, you know, I've been dancing around this for years, but now like it's all out in the open. We know there's a problem and I'm going to test him. I'm going to find out what the hell's going on.  on. This is, after all, one of the basic forms of data that we collect in my field. That is, testing people with problems in their brain to try to figure out what things they can do and what things they can't do. It's a way of figuring out what the basic components of the mind and brain are. It's actually the oldest, most venerable method in our field, and it's still a hugely important one. So I thought, what the hell? So I said, OK, Bob, draw me a sketch map of the floor plan of your house.  And so Bob takes a few minutes and he draws this thing. And it was shocking. The rooms in a rectilinearly arranged house, they weren't even aligned. There was like a soup of lines. There was no organization from one room to the next. And Bob realized this isn't right, is it? But he didn't know how to fix it. And he said he just couldn't visualize what it looked like to be in his house. And so he couldn't draw the floor plan.  OK, he hasn't been there in a couple of days. I gave him another piece of paper. And I said, OK, draw the floor plan of my house, where you are right now. And so Bob took a couple minutes and delivered a similar mess. He couldn't even imagine the layout of the room next to him that he'd been in a few minutes before. And then, trying to channel my inner neuropsychologist, I thought, OK, gave him another piece of paper.  paper and I said, OK, Bob, draw a bicycle. Why did I choose a bicycle? Because it's a multi-part object that has a bunch of different bits that have a particular relationship to each other, just as the rooms in a house have a particular spatial relationship to each other. And I wanted to know, is his problem specifically about places, or is it about any complex multi-part thing that you have to remember the relationships to? Bob is no artist, to put it mildly, but his bicycle was clearly recognizable  as a bicycle, it had the two wheels and the right relationship and it had all the basic parts in roughly the same, the right place. I then had him draw a lobster, another multi-part object, and also his lobster was not beautiful but had everything in the right place. And so that's very telling. He had a specific problem in, I don't know, imagining, reproducing, remembering, it's not totally clear, the arrangements of parts in a room, but not the arrangements of parts in an object.  OK? And we'll get back to that more in a few weeks. OK. So what do I want to say here? Is that all that? So the next day, Bob has an 11-hour surgery, major, hardcore, extreme neurosurgery. Remove a huge piece of bone from the back of your head, pull apart the hemispheres of the brain like this, go in like multiple inches, and remove  of a lime, like holy crap, right? Said lime was right near the vein of Galen, right? Galen lived, what, a couple thousand years ago. The fact that there's a vein of Galen means it's a big ass vein, the kind of vein that even Galen would have found with dissection 2,000 years ago. This lime was all wrapped around and interleaved with the vein of Galen, not good. But because we found the best neurosurgeon, and because we have extreme privilege  and all the possible medical resources and expertise you could possibly hope for, Bob sailed through the surgery. And an hour after the surgery, I'm chatting with him and he's making sense. Amazing. So, and literally two days later, they sent him home. And a few days after that, he's back at work, no problem. Totally fine. But now we get to the question you're probably  probably thinking about, what about his navigational abilities? The sad answer is nothing doing. None of it came back at all. Thank God for iPhones. If Bob lived 30 years ago, he wouldn't be able to function. But he goes everywhere using his iPhone GPS, everywhere. And this fact that he didn't recover his navigational abilities is consistent with a whole literature  that we'll consider later in the course, that often, not always, but often, if you have brain damage, especially to some of these very specialized circuits that we'll talk about, you don't recover later. If the damage is early, you may well recover. Early in life, you may well recover. Children have much more plastic brains that can adjust after brain damage. Adults, not so good.  He's teaching social distancing right to the left, not on the right.  directions or to listen to the GPS directions system. So driving is no problem. It's another kind of left-right. The immediate spatial orientation abilities are absolutely fine. But knowing where am I now and how would I get there from here is blitzed. Other questions? Yeah. Can he recognize what's familiar? Great question. Yes. He can recognize familiar places. What he can't do is he can say, oh, right.  But could he stream together multiple screens at once?  It's not what any of you guys could do. If you guys are driving around in Cambridge or walking around campus, remember when they blocked off this whole middle of campus a couple years ago? It was so irritating. I would go there and it's like, oh, God, they've blocked it off. I can't get over to Lobby 7. Well, you immediately come up with an alternate route. It's like, OK, I guess we're going to have to do this. You come up with an alternate route. This is what a normal navigation system can do. Bob can't do that at all. He's like, route block? No idea. Get out the phone.  Yeah? Is he good at estimating distances? Does he know something is a certain number of miles away? Yes. Yes, he is. And that's very interesting. But that seems to be kind of a different thing. You could think about all the different kinds of cues you have for distance beyond your literal navigation skills. Yeah? Can you manually trace the steps back up one minute, and then up another minute?  I don't know whether you can navigate within buildings.  of them. Yeah. I mean, these are problems you can come up with workarounds. It's not life threatening, but it's extremely inconvenient. Yeah. So this is the case that those navigational skills that he developed a long time ago, those are stronger. So he has a harder time developing. So for example, he said new hotels are a problem, but if the place is more familiar, like his home, is it easier for him to navigate? It's a great question.  the kind of navigational maps you laid down long ago would be intact. So is it just that you can't learn new ones? So it's a great question. The answer is kind of complicated in this case. For routes that he's memorized, there's a whole different system for knowing a route and really having an abstract knowledge of a place that enables you to devise a new route if something is blocked on that route, right? So for highly overlearned routes, he's okay. Like he remembers, like this you do. It's like a sequence.  It's like a memorized motor sequence. You do A, and then B, and then C, and then D. So he's OK with those with roots he learned long ago. But he is not good at coming up with a new root in a place that he learned long ago. All right, we'll take one last question. Yeah?  that, oh, I'm having trouble because he's very much aware.  If he tries to imagine what's behind him, he says that he starts to get it, and it just vaporizes. He just can't hang on to it. He can't construct a stable mental image of nearby places. So I don't know exactly what that means, but he's very articulate and can report what he experiences when he tries to access this kind of information. So what you guys are, we'll go on, but what I want to say is what you guys just did,  is exactly what we do in my field. We try to take a mental ability and tease it apart and say, is it exactly this or is it exactly that? And you guys all just did it beautifully, right? So a lot of what we do in my field is kind of this kind of common sense parsing of mental abilities. What is a particular mental ability? How does it relate to some other one? Are these things separable? Can you lose one and not the other? Do they live in different parts of the brain, et cetera?  All right, so that's the story. I'm going to cash out some of the particular themes that came out from the story that will echo through this course. And the first and most obvious one is the brain isn't just a big bunch of mush, right? It has structure. It has organization. The different bits do different things. Importantly, when Bob had this big lime in his head, he didn't just get  a little bit stupid. No. His IQ, if he'd take an IQ test, would be unchanged. He lost a very specific mental ability. And that is fascinating. But it's also good news for science. Because often when you try to understand a complicated thing, a great way to make progress is to first figure out what the parts are, and then later try to figure out how does each individual part work and how do they work together. But if there's part structure, there's at least a place to start.  Second theme is that some parts of the brain do extremely specific things. Not all of them. Some of them are quite general and are engaged in lots of different mental processes, but some are remarkably specific. We'll talk a lot about that. Third big theme, the organization of the brain echoes the architecture of the mind. I would say the fundamental pieces of the brain are telling us what our fundamental  parts of the mind. And that's why I'm in this field. That's what I think is cool. You know, the brain is just like a bunch of cells. Like it's a physical thing. Who cares about a physical thing? The reason we care about it is that's where our mind lives. And if we study that physical thing, we can learn something about our minds. And that's pretty cosmic, I think. So the point of all of this kind of work is not to say, oh, that mental process is here, not there. Who cares? I don't really care. I mean, at some point you need to have a ballpark sense. You need to know to study the things. But the interesting question  Is not where these things are in the brain, but which mental processes have their own specialized machinery and why those yeah? Another important theme how do brains change right Bob didn't recover after his brain damage in that very particular mental function that he lost If all of that had happened when he was five five years old he probably would have right So how do brains change over normal development? How do they change from learning and experience?  How do they change after injury? And the final theme echoed in that story is there are lots and lots of different ways to study the brain. There are the simple behavioral observations. Bob can't navigate, but he can do everything else. OK, that's really deep and informative. Low tech, but really powerful. The anatomical brain images that showed where the line was in Bob's brain. That gives you another kind of information. Where's the physical structure of the brain?  the functional images that we had done in my lab to discover the parahippocampal place area, and the studies of what mental abilities are preserved and which are lost in people who have alterations of their brain. So those are just a few of the kinds of methods in our field, each of which tells us about a different kind of thing about the brain. So those are the themes I was trying to get at here. So let's move on to the work.  why, how, and what of exploring the brain. I'm going to assign the TAs to get me to shut up at, let's see, we're supposed to end at five minutes before the end of class. Is that right? Is that MIT tradition? OK. So at, oh my, shockingly soon, 11.45, you're going to, no. Oh, great. Thank you. Thank you. This is one of the many things TAs are for. They pick up the hundreds of typos and mindos and all of that. Excellent. I'm thinking, how the hell did I  I so mistimed this. Thank you, Heather. Okay, good. We'll go on. Okay, why should we study the brain? First, most obvious reason, know thyself. Know what this thing is that's operating in our heads. This is who you are, right? It's your brain. There are lots of very fine and important organs in the body, but the brain is special, right? So, you know, a heart is important. You'd die without it, but it's the brain  and it's your identity. So there's a reason that surgeons do heart transplants. That makes sense. Something wrong with your heart, you need another heart. But why don't they do brain transplants? That would make sense. If there's something wrong with my brain, it doesn't make sense to take someone else's brain and put it in here because then I'd be that other person. It doesn't make sense because the brain is who you are. So the brain is really special. It's not just another organ. That's why a few years ago we had the decade of the brain.  Not the decade of the pancreas or the liver or the kidney. People need to study these things. They need to know how to fix them. They're important, but they're not as cosmic as the brain. Second reason why we should understand brains, and that is to understand the limits of human knowledge. The more we understand about the human mind, the more we can actually evaluate how good our knowledge is.  Are there things that we might not be able to think? Possible true scientific theories we might not be able to understand ever? You can think of studying the mind as a kind of empirical epistemology, a way to actually know about the knower so we can figure out how good the knowledge is in that knower. So that's another reason. A third reason is to advance AI. And so up until a few years ago, I used to give lectures on vision.  They would all start with some version of this. You guys all have amazing visual abilities in the back third of your brain that does vision. You can do all this incredible stuff that no machine can touch. Hat's off to you. You have an amazing visual system back here. And those guys in AI, it is mostly guys, guys, gals, whatever, those people in AI could only dream of coming up with algorithms as good as the one that's running in the back of your head.  quite start the lectures that way anymore. So if any of you have been living in a cave and not heard about deep nets, there's been a massive revolution. And all of a sudden, deep nets are doing things that are really close to human abilities, particularly in vision. So for example, in visual object recognition, machines were way far behind human vision until very recently, especially when this paper here came out, was published in 2011.  2012, first author Krzyzewski. It has now been cited an astonishing 33,000 times. Actually, I made this slide a couple weeks ago. It's probably been cited 36,000 times by now. You could look it up on Google Scholar and find out. That is a huge number of citations. The influence of this paper is ginormous. Probably half of you have already heard about this paper. Raise your hand if you've heard about this paper. Oh, OK. All right. Major big news. So what's so important about this paper?  Well, they trained, as probably most of you know, they trained a deep net on the over a million images in ImageNet, a massive computer database of images. And they basically taught it to do object recognition. And it performed much more accurately than any previous system, and it approaches human abilities. So this is major, this is a radical change in the situation that we were in five years ago. So things have changed radically. So just as an example, here's some  of the figures from that seminal paper. So here is one of the images from ImageNet that AlexNet, this trained network, was tested on. And the correct answer, according to ImageNet, is that that's a mite. And here's what AlexNet says. Its number one first answer is mite. And its second, third, fourth answers are black widow, cockroach, et cetera. So pretty damn good. The mite is even sticking off the edge of the frame, and it gets it. Containership, first choice containership, pretty good.  Good. Second choice makes sense. Lifeboat, not bad. Look at that. Motor scooter. I can barely even see the motor scooter in there. But AlexNet, awesome. Leopard, awesome. Even when AlexNet makes a mistake, the mistake is totally understandable. Like according to ImageNet, that is a picture of a grill. And AlexNet calls it a convertible. I'm siding with AlexNet on this one over ImageNet. This, the correct answer is mushroom.  And AlexNet says agaric. I had to look that up. It's like a particular kind of mushroom. This one's pretty funny. ImageNet says that's pictures of cherry. There's cherries in the foreground. But AlexNet says dalmatian. I'm siding with AlexNet on this. And Madagascar cat, et cetera. So pretty amazing. And nothing even close to this was possible before 2012. So this is very recent history. And it has totally shaken up the field in lots of ways.  So it's been transformative not just for computer science, but it's also been transformative for cognitive science and neuroscience Because now we have algorithms like here's this deep net and it does this thing So that's a possible theory of how humans do it. It's a possible computationally precise theory of what's going on in here and we didn't used to have those and now we have those for a number of domains and that's shaking up the field there will be a whole lecture on deep nets and how you can use them to think about Minds and brains toward the end of the course  guest lecture by my postdoc, Catherine Dobbs. And we'll hear more about that. But let's first step back a second and say, OK, do they really perform as well as humans, even on just object recognition? Well, what if we tested it on images not in ImageNet? Like, ImageNet is a pretty good test, because these things, as you can see, are highly variable. They have backgrounds. They're complicated. They're real-world images. But they were photographs taken by people in a particular way, with a particular  goal. And most of the photographs you take, you throw out, they don't end up in ImageNet. ImageNet is a weird little idiosyncratic subset of the kind of visual experience that we have. So would this really generalize? So it so happens that Boris Katz and Andre Barbu, across the street in Seasale, have been doing some very interesting studies. This stuff isn't published yet, but I got their permission to tell you about this cool stuff they're doing. And they're saying, hey, let's test AlexNet and other similar deep nets since  then on a more realistic, harder version of object recognition that's more characteristic of what humans do. And so they're generating this huge data set of stimuli that they crowdsource. And so workers on Mechanical Turk go on there and create images for them. So they get instructions like, hold an object in this particular location or at this angle or move it here and send us the images. So they are getting, I think, hundreds of thousands of images to test this on. And they're much more variable  in the location of the object in the image and its orientation and so forth. So for example, you guys have no problem telling what that thing is, but it's a slightly atypical example. Likewise, what's the object on the floor there? You can tell what it is, but it's a slightly atypical example. And so what Boris and Andre are finding is that human performance is still pretty good on these images, but the deep nets are terrible at this stuff.  more recent ones drops from 71% correct on ImageNet to around 25% correct on these images. And the other similar fancy more recent networks do similarly badly. So on the one hand, AI, the deep nets are awesome and transformative, no question about it. But on the other hand, despite all the hype, they're still not quite like human object recognition, right? They're a whole lot closer than they used to be.  be, but they're not really there. And more generally, what about harder problems like image understanding, not just labeling and classification, but understanding what's going on in an image? So you guys have probably seen image captioning bots. There are lots of these around now. This kind of hit the scene in 2016 when Google AI came out with a captioning algorithm. And of course, right around the same time, Microsoft had a captioning algorithm.  how they do. So this is an example. You give this algorithm this picture here, and it says, that's a dinosaur on top of a surfboard. That's pretty damn good, right? Like, OK, wow. Let's look more generally how well this thing works at other examples. OK, it looks at this, and it says, that's a group of people on a field playing football. It's like, wow, OK. A snow-covered field, pretty good.  you in and ding ding, posing for a picture. I don't know, but these things are very good at face recognition. That's probably exactly those two people. A car parked in a parking lot, pretty good. A large ship in the water, pretty good. A clock tower lit up at night, awesome. A vintage photo of a pond. Well, the vintage part, I wonder where the pond is. There's a little water in there. I don't know.  way off. A group of people that are standing in the grass near a bridge. Not really. There's grass. There's a bridge, sort of. There's people, but not really. A group of people standing on top of a boat. Definitely not. A building with a cake. What? A person holding a cell phone.  Not. A group of stuffed animals. I love this one. A necklace made of bananas. Wow, we've really landed on Mars here. A sign sitting on the grass. Talk about missing the boat. Now look at this picture for a second. Just figure out what's going on here.  seconds. Everyone got it? There's a lot going on here. OK. So this algorithm says, I think it's a group of people standing next to a man in a suit and tie. And the algorithm is correct. But the algorithm has profoundly missed the boat. OK? So I'm channeling. Actually, I stole these slides from Josh Tenenbaum. But let me channel him for a moment and say what his big idea is, which I think is really important. And that is that both humans and deep nets are very good  at pattern recognition, pattern classification. This is a cat or a dog or a car or a toaster. What they're not good at, what humans are good at, but the deep nets are not, is building models to understand the world. And so when you look at this picture, there are all kinds of things that are crucial for really understanding at a deep level what's going on in here. We need to know what some people here know, but the guy on the scale does not know.  recognize that that's James Comey, I think it is. Here's Obama with his foot on the scale. You need to know that people find it embarrassing if they weigh too much. You need to know that he can't see that Obama's doing it. You need to know that they can see it even though he can't, and that's kind of the essence of humor. There's just a whole universe of rich structural information going in here that is part of what it means to understand this picture. And no deep net is even close.  to doing that kind of thing. So bottom line of all this is, or let me just go on more generally, AI systems can't navigate new situations, infer what others believe, use language to communicate, write poetry and music to express how they feel, or create math to build bridges, devices, and life-saving medicines.  our leader, Jim DiCarlo, head of this department, published in Wired a year ago in a beautiful article on the limitations of deep nets. But more generally, the point is that, yes, AI is taking a massive leap now, and we're right in the middle of it. And it's super exciting, and it's helpful to neuroscience and cognitive science. But AI has a lot to learn from us, too, right? A lot to learn from what's going on in here and how this thing works that those AI systems still can't touch. OK, so all of that was my third point.  reason for studying, we're still in the why are we studying the human brain. The fourth reason to study the human brain is the one most compelling to me, and that is that it is just simply the greatest intellectual quest of all time. We could fight about cosmology. I'm not going to fight with you about anything else. I don't think there's any contest. It's the greatest intellectual quest of all time. And that's why I'm in it, and that's why I hope it'll be fun for you. Okay, that was the why. How are we going to study  studied the human brain. So here's this thing. How are we going to figure out how it works? It's kind of daunting. It's not totally obvious. The first thing to realize is that there are lots of levels of organization in this thing, and hence lots of ways of studying it. We could look at molecules and their interactions. Lots of people in this building do that. We could look at properties of individual neurons. We could look at circuits of neurons interacting with each other. We could look at entire brain regions and what their functions are.  We could look at networks of multiple brain regions interacting with each other. And so all of those things are possible. But actually, what we're going to do in the course is none of those things in particular. Instead, we're going to ask a somewhat different question. And that question is, how does the brain give rise to the mind? And to understand that question, we're going to do more at this level and less at the upper levels. So to answer this question, we need  we need to start with the mind. If we're going to understand how does this thing produce a mind, we need to first figure out what is a mind. What do we know about minds? And so we need to start with the various mental functions that minds carry out, things like perception, vision, hearing, aspects of cognition, like understanding language, thinking about people, thinking about things, et cetera. And so for each mental function, what we're going to do in here  start by trying to understand how it works in minds as well as we can, or what it is that we're trying to understand that minds can do. What is computed and how? And then we're going to look at its brain basis and try to figure out what we can figure out about how that mental function is implemented in a brain. So the first question we'll ask for all of these domains is, is there specialized machinery to do that thing? And then we'll ask, what information is represented in the relevant parts of the brain? And when is that information represented?  OK? And how? OK, so how are we going to answer those questions? Well, there's lots and lots of methods in our field. OK? And so the first set of methods, if we want to understand minds, the first set of methods are the basic stuff of cognitive science, psychophysics. That means showing people visual stimuli or playing them sounds and asking them what they see or hear. Nice and low tech, but lots has been learned from those methods. You collect reaction time and accuracy, and it's amazing how much you can learn from these  methods that have been around for a hundred years or more. Perceptual illusions are similarly very informative about how minds work. Now let me say an important thing that arises here. Last year was the first time I taught this course and I would say it went so-so. I'm aiming for it to be much better this year. And one of the ways I'm trying to do that is to be responsive to the student avowals I got last year, which were not fabulous across the board, hurt my feelings badly. But once I got over myself, I decided to just listen to  them and try to fix it. And one way to fix it is to be honest with you today about what this course is going to cover. So in my evals, student 50458, bless them, offered this comment. This class was not sold in the correct way. It should not be called the human brain because it was basically just a cognitive science, not a brain class. I expected to learn very different material. So I don't know who the student is. I wish I could apologize to them, but I will say to you, sorry, student 50458.  4, 5, 8. Sorry I didn't make that clear. The fundamental reason the brain is cool is that it gives rise to the mind. And that means that studying the biological properties of the brain without considering the mental functions it implements, it would be kind of like trying to study the physical properties of a book without considering the meaning of its text. So we're going to spend a lot of time doing cognitive science in here. And if you had a different impression, sorry about that. But that's what we're doing here.  All right, so how are we going to answer this? Lots of cognitive science. So how are we going to look at the brain basis? Well, we're going to look at neuropsychology patients, people like Bob who have damage to the brain and what functions get preserved and lost. We'll look at a lot of studies with functional MRI. Neurophysiology, where you can record from individual neurons in animal brains and in rare cases, even in human brains under clinical situations where they need to have electrodes in their brain anyway for neurosurgery.  We'll look at EEG recorded from electrodes on the scalp, and MEG recording from magnetic fields from squids placed next to the scalp. We'll look at connectivity measures with a method called diffusion tractography, et cetera. So lots of methods. And so which mental functions will we cover? Well, to tell you about that, I need to tell you about the huge progress that has happened in our field in the last 20 years. All of this is quite recent.  And so let's back up to 1990. Here is approximately what we knew about the organization of the human brain in 1990. The black ovals are the bits that are primary sensory and motor regions that have been known for a long time, even by 1990. And the colored bits are the bits where we had some idea that face recognition might go on somewhere in the back end of the bottom of the right hemisphere because of people who had damage back there and lost their face recognition ability.  sometimes preserving their ability to visually recognize words and scenes and objects, only losing their ability to recognize faces. The language regions we had known about for nearly 200 years from Broca and Wernicke and others who had studied patients with damage in those regions and noted that they had problems with language function. Similarly, many people had reported that if you have damage up here in the parietal lobes, you sometimes lose your ability to direct your attention to different places in the visual system.  So that was approximately what was known in 1990. And here's what we know now. We now know, thanks largely to functional MRI, that for dozens of regions in the brain, in every one of you, we have a pretty good idea of the function of that region. This is major progress, right? This is a kind of rough sketch of the organization of the human mind and brain that we have now that we didn't have 20 years ago.  20 years ago, and that's awesome. And so that has made possible a lot of progress building with other methods. And so what we'll study in this course is we'll focus on those mental functions where the brain bases are best understood. And that will include things like the visual perception of color, shape, and motion, visual recognition of faces, places, bodies, and words, and scenes. Didn't make it on the slide.  Yes, it did. Perceiving scenes and navigating. Understanding numbers. Yes, there's a whole lot about the brain basis of understanding numbers. Perceiving speech and perceiving music. Understanding language. Understanding other people and their minds. So those are the kinds of topics where there's been a lot of progress recently in understanding the brain basis of those mental functions. And so those are the ones we'll focus on. And that means there's going to be a lot on perception.  high-level vision and high-level audition. Because that's one where a lot of progress has been made, and it's also a lot of the cortex. As I mentioned a moment ago, the whole back third of your brain does vision construed broadly. Some people might say, why is she spending all this time in vision? Well, it's a big part of what your brain does. We are very visual animals, so we'll spend a lot of time on vision. For each of these functions, we will ask, to what extent is this mental function implemented?  in its own specialized brain machinery? Are there multiple different brain regions that carry out that function? What does each one do? Is there a division of labor between those different regions? How does that system arise in development? Does it have homologs in other species? Are these things uniquely human, or which of them are? And also, along the way, other side cool questions that will come up.  special about the human brain? How come we are taking over and largely destroying the planet and other species are not? Besides destroying the planet, we're doing some other cool things like inventing science and engineering and medicine and architecture and poetry and literature and music, all these other awesome things that other species aren't doing. How come our brains are doing that and other species aren't? Where does knowledge come from? You guys know all this stuff.  How much of that stuff was wired in at birth, and how much of it did you get from experience? How much can our minds and brains change over time? Can we go study a new thing and get a whole new brain region for that thing? Can we change the basic structure just by training or after brain damage? Can we think without language? How many of you have wondered about that question?  Really basic question. Anya's answering it. Anya and some others, but Anya's doing a lot to answer that question. They're actually empirical answers to these long-standing deep questions that everyone wonders about. That's pretty cool. Somebody back there asked a while ago about awareness. Can we think, perceive, understand without awareness? How much can go on, like in the basement of the brain when we don't even know what's going on down there? We'll consider all of these other cool questions.  of things we won't cover in this course for various reasons that could have been in here and just aren't. There's only so much time. Motor control, it's really important to know how you do things like pick up objects and plan actions. And we're just not covering that. Something had to go. Subcortical function, this is a very corticocentric course. Most of the course will deal with the cortex. That's where most of conscious thinking and reasoning and cognition happens. There's a lot of good stuff down  in the basement of the brain, and it's going to get pretty short shrift. Not for any good reason, just what it is. Decision making, important field, not getting much coverage in here. Importantly, circuit level mechanisms, explanations of cognition. Like if you think that we're going to understand not only what it means to understand the meaning of a sentence, but that I'm going to give you a wiring diagram of the neurons that implement that function, sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but nobody has a freaking clue how you could get a bunch of neurons  to understand the meaning of a sentence. So that's exciting. That means there's a field for you guys to waltz into. And probably in your lifetimes, people will start to crack these things. But just to know what we're headed into, rarely, for almost no high-level mental functions, do we have anything like a wiring diagram level understanding of any perceptual or cognitive function. So that's not in the cards for this course, because it doesn't exist in the field.  That kind of thing, there are cases where you can make progress. You can understand, say, fear conditioning in a mouse. Those circuits are being cracked wide open by people in this building, people all around the world with spectacular precision. They know the specific classes of neurons, their connectivity. They know every damn thing about them. But it's like, how does a mouse learn that this thing is to be afraid of this thing? OK, that's important. But for more complex aspects of cognition in humans, we can't usually have that kind of  circuit level understanding. Lots of other things that will get short shrift. Memory, not for any good reason. I mean, there's a lot of coverage of memory in 900 and 901. And it's just somehow I have a blind spot for understanding, for knowing how to talk interestingly about memory. So I'm not going to give you a boring lecture on memory. Instead, I'm not going to give you any lecture on memory until I learn how to talk about it interestingly. Reinforcement learning and reward systems, I'm going to try to pull some of that in. But it's not going to be a major focus, even though it's a really important part of cognition.  tension, there might be some at the end. OK. OK. How many of you have taken 900? OK, looks like a little over a half. OK. How many have taken 901? Yeah, a little over half. OK, good. So if you have, great. Good for you. This course is designed as a tier two course for people who have taken 900 or 901. If you haven't,  you're probably OK, but you might need to do a little extra work. And so I've already posted online and in the syllabus information about actually a lecture I gave a year ago on some of the background stuff that is no longer taught in this course. People hated it when I taught them stuff they'd already encountered before, so I'm trying to minimize that. And so that's a backup for those of you who haven't taken these courses. If you're worried about this, chat with me afterwards. I think it will be OK. Just count on doing a little bit of extra work, not much.  OK, for those of us who have taken it, there's going to be a little bit of overlap. It's simply impossible to have zero overlap. I mean, what does John Gabrielli in 900 and Mark Baer in 901 do? They survey the whole broad field, and they pick the coolest stuff out of every little bit, and they teach it to you exactly as they should. But that means that when I come along and try to say, I'm going to do a more intensive coverage of the coolest things, there's going to be a teeny bit of overlap. But I'll try to not make it too much, just because the coolest  stuff is the coolest stuff, right? OK. Also, the spin and the goals of this course are quite different from both 900 and 901. You will have to memorize a few things, but not much. My real goal in this course is to have you understand things, not memorize a sea of disjointed facts. OK? So a little more on the goals. Really, what I want you to get out of this course is to appreciate the big questions in the field and what is at stake  theoretically in each. I want you to understand the methods in human cognitive neuroscience, what each one can tell you, what it can't, how different combinations of methods can work synergistically and complementarily to answer different facets of a question. I do want you to gain some actual knowledge about some of the domains of cognition where we've learned a bunch, both at the cognitive level and the brain level. Things like face recognition, navigation, language understanding, music, stuff like that.  Are the papers going to be straight out of research labs, or are they going to be the annual review?  Real deal, not someone else's blurry, they just read the abstracts and put in some stuff in the review article. No, you're going to read the actual paper. That's the whole deal. Yep. OK, so those are the goals. Good? A few things, why no textbook? This field is moving too fast for a textbook. Plus, I have strong opinions, and I don't like any of the textbooks. So any textbook is out of date. We're going to be reading hot stuff that's hot off the press, and so there's no  that's not in the textbooks yet, and so we're skipping that. And you're going to go straight to original research articles. So we'll be occasional review articles where relevant, but mostly part of the agenda of this course is to teach you to be not afraid of and able to read current articles in the field. All right. You've all been waiting for this. OK. Details on the grading. Pretty standard. Midterm, 25% of the grade. Final, 25%. It will be cumulative, but weighted toward the second half. There's going to be a lot of reading  and writing assignments, approximately two papers to read per week. And for usually one of those papers per week, you will have a very short written assignment in which usually I ask a few simple questions and maybe one paragraph-level think question. The essence of these tasks is not the written assignment itself. The essence of the task is to understand the paper. If you've understood the paper as it  you read it, then you should be able to answer those questions pretty straightforwardly. And let me just say that understanding a scientific paper is not trivial. When I read a scientific paper right in my area where I have all of the background, it takes me hours. Hours. It may be five pages. It still takes me hours. It's just how it is. So when I assign a paper and you say, oh, it's only three pages. I can do that in 20 minutes. Oh, no, you can't. No, you can't. And that's part of what I want to do.  want you to learn how to do is how to really read and understand a scientific paper, allocate the time it takes to really get it. So that's a big part of the agenda in this task. All the stuff, the assignments and the submission of the assignments will all happen on Stellar. Your first written response to a paper is due February 12 at 6 PM on Stellar. But there are other readings that are assigned before that. A note about the schedule, I struggled a lot trying to both have the assignments  happen when you have already learned enough in lectures to know how to do it, but have it close enough to the topic at hand so it didn't seem like no longer relevant. That's hard to do both of those things. So the compromise is all of the assignments are due at 6 PM the night before the class in which they're assigned. And so if you see that it's assigned on the 13th, if it's listed on the lecture for the 13th, check carefully. It's probably due the night of the 12th, the night before.  We and the TAs can look at it, figure out what you understood, what you didn't, and how to incorporate and explain whatever you didn't get in the next lecture. All right. Quizzes. I haven't done this before. No thing I'm going to try. There are going to be about eight of these. They're going to be very brief. They're going to happen at the end of class, in class, and you will do them on your computer or your iPhone using Google Forms. If anybody doesn't have a computer or an iPhone they can bring to class the days of those quizzes. Let us know after class and we'll come over  up with a solution. And the idea of these is not to fish out an obscure fact that was in one of the reading assignments and ding you on it. I'm not interested in that. The goal of this is just to keep you up to date, keep you doing the readings, keep you up with the material. And if you basically are understanding what you're reading and understanding the lecture material, maybe you glance at it briefly before you should do final quizzes. They're just kind of reality checks for us to know what people are getting and not.  OK, first quiz is February 20. Blah, blah. There is one longer written assignment that is not due with the usual schedule of all the other things. It's due near the end. And in that one, you will actually design an experiment in a particular area. And that will be, I don't know yet, three to five pages, something like that. We'll give you more details on exactly how you want to organize this. And it will be very specific, like state your exact hypothesis, state your exact experimental design, et cetera. And you'll get practice with those things in advance.  All right. So those are the grading and requirements. And this is the, you have this all in the syllabus in front of you, this is the lineup of topics. But very briefly, let me try to give you the arc of the class. So this is the introduction. Next time, we're going to do just a teeny bit of neuroanatomy. There will be a teeny bit of overlap with 900 and 901 there. I'm going to whip through it in very superficial form. I'm doing that largely because on the following class, we have an amazing privilege.  which is that one of the greatest neuroscientists alive today, Anne Graybiel, will be doing an actual brain dissection right here in this class, right in front of you. It's going to be awesome. I can't wait. It's an incredible privilege. It will be a real human brain, and you guys will be here with all her apparatus, and you guys will be clustered around. And if it's this many, God help us, but we'll figure out how to make it work. Let me just say, if there are listeners in here, I may have to tell listeners they can't come, because I'm very sensitive about not having too many people. So stay tuned on that.  quite decided yet. Depends how many people are taking the class. But it's going to be amazing. And I want to remind you of just some basics so you're not asking her, like, what is the hippocampus? OK, so I know you should all know that. But we'll just do bare basics. OK, and then we'll have the dissection. That will be great. And also, another thing to say is I mentioned that the subcortical regions are going to get short shrift in this class. That's true. But a lot of what you see in a dissection is the subcortical stuff, right? Cortex is great.  all looks the same. You kind of can't say, oh, that's this region. That's the other region. Well, you can, but it doesn't look any different from any other region. So that's where the subcortical stuff will happen. OK. So then I'm going to do a couple of lectures that focus on high-level vision, perceiving motion and color and shape and faces and scenes and bodies and stuff like that. And we will use those both to teach you that content and also to teach you the vast array of methods  in this field. We will then have a lecture on the debates about the organization of visual cortex in humans. I have a particular view. I'm very fond of views that some patches of cortex are very, very functionally specific. Not everyone believes that, so I have signed readings of people who have different views. We will consider that. I will try to expose you to the alternate views and tell you why I'm teaching, why I still believe mine, but why other smart people believe  different things, right? OK. We will then move up the system from perception, and we will spend two meetings talking about scene perception and navigation. You got a hint about what an interesting area this is from the story of Bob. We'll consider more what we've learned from studies of patients with brain damage, from functional MRI, from physiology in animals, from cognitive science, from the whole glorious menagerie of methods to understand navigation. It's a really fascinating area.  In the two lectures after that, we'll consider development. How do you wire up a brain? How much is present at birth? What is specified in the genes? What is learned? And a lot of that will focus on the navigation system and the face system, simply because that's where there's a lot known. We'll consider some other things. But those are two areas where there's super exciting work from just the last three or four years. And so that's what we'll focus on there. I'm then going to do a lecture on brains in blind people.  How are they different? How are they the same? What does that tell us? And then you have the midterm. Then we're going to move on and consider number. How do you instantly know that that's three fingers and that's two without having to do anything all that complicated? And if I had 25 fingers and held them up, you would immediately get a sense that it was about 25. You might not know if it was 22 or 28, but you would know it was about 25. And there are particular brain regions that compute that for you, and we will consider.  are all of that. And there's a very rich array of information from studies of infant cognition, from animal behavior, from brain imaging, from brain damage, from single unit physiology, and from computation, all of which inform our understanding of number. Those are my favorite lectures, where we can take one domain of cognition and inform it with all of the methods. And number is a really great example. Then we'll talk a little bit about, well, one of my TAs said, call it neuroeconomics. It will sound good. But actually, what I'm going to try to do is sort of neuroeconomics.  will be about pleasure and pain and reward and how we think about those things. And then, that's down to April 3rd, just as a side note, all of these things are things that are pretty similar between humans and at least primates. And some of them are shared with rodents. And most of the things after that are things that are really uniquely human. So we'll be really moving away with less available animal literature to inform the stuff we're looking at.  at because animals can't do these things. And so necessarily far from the details of individual neurons and circuits, but there's still lots cool that can be said about how you understand speech, how you appreciate music. There will be a guest lecture just for fun on brain machine interface by Michael Cohen, who's working in my lab now and who has a great lecture on this topic. And then we'll spend a couple of lectures on language, how you understand and produce language and what the relevant brain regions are.  what we know about it from cognition and lots of other methods, and what the relationship is between language and thought. Then we'll think about how we think about other people. This is called theory of mind, how I can look out at this lecture and try to evaluate from your facial expression. Are they bored, sleepy, overworked, fascinated, excited, all of this kind of stuff that all of us do moment to moment in any conversation and that, you know, yes, lectures are doing all the time.  Even if I know that you guys have too much work and that's why you're sleepy and I shouldn't take it personally. I'm still noticing. Anyway, then we'll go on and consider brain networks. So of course, brain function doesn't happen in just a single region, even if we spend a lot of time studying individual regions. There's considerable work trying to figure out which sets of regions work together and how could we discover that and what are those broader networks of brain regions. And then on May 6, you will have turned in your  longer written assignment designing your own experiment. And then on May 6, we will work together in groups to refine those experiments and really hash out the details so you actually know how to design an experiment. And then we will have this guest lecture from my postdoc, Katharina Dobbs, on deep nets and what they can tell us about cognition and brains. And then we'll talk about attention awareness. And then I'm not totally sure what we're going to do in the last class, but what I'm voting for is that the amazing TAs each give a short talk  on the cool stuff they're doing. But that's under discussion. OK, that's the arc of the class. Questions? All clear? Great. Well, if I have five more minutes, maybe I'll do one other little thing. Let me try this. You asked, I'm going to try to learn everybody's names, but I'm not doing that yet. Because some of you might not show up, and I will have wasted a whole piece of my brain encoding it. No, just kidding.  But anyway, I remember that you asked, are you going to read current papers? Yes, it is. And you're right. It's daunting. But let me just say a little bit about how to read papers. This is not a stats course, and we haven't prerequisited stats. Neither is it a course on the physics of MRI. So there will be parts of every MRI paper that have a lot of gobbledygook. We scanned with this scanning procedure. We used this kind of scanner and this kind of blah, blah, blah. Lots of gobbledygook. You guys don't need to worry about that.  about that. About the stats, it's kind of a judgment call. Everyone in here should have an idea of what a P-level means. And I hope a sense of what a t-test is and an ANOVA. If you don't, I should probably tell you that offline because that's pretty basic. But what a correlation is. Beyond that, just use your intuitions about those things. And this is not a course about understanding the details of the stats in each experiment. There just isn't room to cover all that in the substance of the studies as well. So when you read a paper,  For example, here's a paper, a very old paper. You come across this, and it's like, OK, here are all these words. It goes on for 20 pages. And how do you even dig in? Well, the way to dig in is to start by saying, what question is being asked in this paper? If the paper is well-written, you'll be able to find that in the abstract, blah, blah, blah, to study the effect of face inversion on the human fusiform face area. We'll talk about that more later. But if you fish through the abstract,  to find what question's being asked. And it's the first thing you should figure out about a paper. You don't necessarily read a paper beginning through the end. I think it's better to start with this list of questions in your head and look for the answers to those questions. Second question, what do they find? If the abstract is well-written, you can find that in the abstract as well. Signal intensity from the fusiform face area was reduced when grayscale faces were presented upside down. OK, kind of boring, but there it is.  That's the finding of this paper. What is the interpretation? In other words, who cares? Who cares about this? If you look in here in the abstract, FFA responds to faces per se, rather than to the low level features present in faces. We'll talk more about what that means. You guys have an assignment about that, probably several assignments about that kind of question. Next question you want to ask yourself  what is the design of this experiment? Often for this you have to go beyond the abstract. And I should say for even these earlier questions, sometimes you won't find them in the abstract. That just means the abstract is not well written. But that exists. OK, to get the design, like what exactly did they do? Usually you have to fit in what exactly was done and how were the data analyzed. You need to fish farther. You need to fish around other parts of the paper. And of course, all of those questions  OK, so I just said, OK, what question? And I circled this part. But there are many levels to what question. So you can get more on why is that inverted question important. You look through usually in the introduction to the paper. Does the FFA respond to faces per se or to a confounding visual feature which tends to be present in faces? Second, is it true that inverted faces cannot engage face-specific mechanisms? Blah, blah, blah. So that gives you a little more background on what the question is. There are different levels and depths.  So these are all things you want to be looking for when you read a paper. What exactly was done? We measured MRI responses in the FFA to upright and inverted faces. I don't expect you to understand all this. These are just giving you schematically how you proceed when you're reading a paper. More on the interpretation or who cares. This result would show that face-specific mechanisms are engaged only or predominantly by upright faces, blah, blah, blah. You can fish through for those things. Point is to have those questions in your head when you read a paper.  It's much more easy and engaging to read something if you have an agenda when you read it. And so your agenda in reading scientific papers is to answer those questions for yourself. More stuff. What was the design and logic? Often that's deep in the methods. You have to fish around and find it. There will be some set of conditions and designs. We'll talk more about all this kind of stuff. What exactly was done? Blah, blah. More details.  example of the kind of gobbledygook that you can ignore. So subjects were scanned on a 1 and 1 half T scanner. And there are all these, like here's the example of said gobbledygook. You can ignore this in this class. Every method will have different kinds of gobbledygook. This is MRI gobbledygook. You can ignore it. It matters a lot, but not here. What else? How are the data analyzed? Sometimes there's a data analysis section.  or a results section or a method section that will tell you, you can find that, figure it out. OK. What was the finding? Here's more on the finding. Again, you just fish through for these things. So the point is just, when you're reading a paper, it's not necessarily what I do is I read the title, I read the abstract. And then I start answering those questions for myself. And sometimes at that point, I'm skipping to figures, I'm skipping to methods. Any of that is fine. OK?  to understand each word, especially deep in the methods. I don't know. Was that helpful at all? We'll try it. And you guys will give me feedback. And if it works, great. And if not, we'll do more on how to read papers. All right. It's 1225. See you on Monday. "
